  return `Given the weightlifting program, potentially consisting of weeks and days, and also lists of exercises, sets and reps, reformat it in the way that:
* It always starts with a week name, on a new line. Week name is always prefixed with pound character, like "# Week 1".
* After week name there goes day name, also on a new line. Day name is always prefixed with double pound character, like "## Day 1".
* After day name, there goes a list of exercises for that day.
* Each exercise starts with a new line
* First always goes the exercise name
* Then, after slash (/) - sets x reps. E.g. 5x5, 3x1, 1x3, etc. If there's a range of reps, use dash (-) to separate them. E.g. 3x3-5, 2x4-8.
* If there are multiple sets of different reps, separate them with comma. E.g. "3x3, 2x4-8, 1x10-12", or "3, 4, 5", or "1x3, 1x4, 1x5" or "3x3-6, 5, 5, 5".
* If there are RPEs specified, add them to sets x reps, after a space, prefixed with "@" character. For example 3 sets of 4 reps with 7 RPE would be "3x4 @7"
* If there is rest timer specified, add it to sets x reps, after a space, suffixes with "s" character. For example: "3x5 60s", or "3x7 @8 60s"
* After the list of exercises, there go more days (again, starting with the day name with double pound), or more weeks.
* Set x reps section format is VERY strict. DO NOT ADD WORDS OR PHRASES THERE!!!. Only set numbers x reps numbers, RPE and timer are allowed to be there. Things like "3 x failure", "3 til failure", etc are FORBIDDEN!
* For AMRAP or sets to failure, add "+" after the reps. For example: "3x8+", or "5, 3, 1+" (in this case last set is AMRAP)

Example:
# Week 1
## Day 1
Bench Press, Barbell / 3x3
Biceps Curl, Dumbbell / 3x8
Biceps Curl, Dumbbell / 3x8 @8
Incline Bench Press, Barbell / 3x8 @8

## Day 2
Squat, Barbell / 5x5 @9 120s
Leg Press, LeverageMachine / 1x8 @9 120s, 4x4 @8 60s

There's a list of built-in exercises. If user provided exercise has slightly different name, but means the same
exercise - use the exercise from the list. Usually you can drop the equipment name from the exercise name,
or add it after the exercise name.
Examples:
* if user entered "Incline DB Press", use "Incline Bench Press, dumbbell".
* if user typed "Pull-ups" - use "Pull Up".
* if user entered "Barbell Rows" - use "Bent Over Row"
* if user entered "Calf Raise" - use "Standing Calf Raise"
* if user entered "DB Bench Press" - use "Bench Press, dumbbell"
* etc - try to find the similar exercise in the list below and use it.

IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU TRY TO FIND SIMILAR EXERCISES FROM THE LIST AND USE THEM IN THE OUTPUT!!!

The list of built-in exercises is case sensitive, so change the case if necessary.
If user entered something like "Double Rope Pushdown" - we don't have such exercise in the list, so you keep it as is. The list of built-in exercises:

${exerciseList}.

Only output the list of exercises, nothing else, no explanation text. This is the text that you need to reformat:`;
