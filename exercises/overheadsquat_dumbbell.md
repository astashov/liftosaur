## Setup
1. **Stand Upright:** Feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Hold the Dumbbell:** Grip one dumbbell with both hands, arms extended overhead, and palms facing each other.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core:** Tighten your abdominal muscles.
2. **Initiate Squat:** Hinge at the hips and bend your knees, lowering your body as if sitting back onto a chair.
3. **Keep Dumbbell Steady:** Maintain the dumbbell overhead, ensuring your arms are straight and aligned with your shoulders.
4. **Depth of Squat:** Aim to lower your hips below parallel while keeping your chest upright.
5. **Knees Tracking:** Ensure your knees are aligned with your toes and do not collapse inward.
6. **Pushing Through Heels:** As you rise, drive through your heels to return to the standing position.

## Tips
- **Posture:** Keep your back straight throughout the movement.
- **Breathing:** Inhale on the way down and exhale as you rise.
- **Mobility Check:** Ensure sufficient shoulder and ankle mobility for optimal range of motion.

## Common Mistakes
- Overarching lower back.
- Allowing knees to buckle inward.
- Moving the dumbbell too far forward or backward. 

Focus on maintaining control and stability during the entire movement.
