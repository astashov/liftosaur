## Setup
1. **Select the Weight**: Adjust the machine to a suitable weight for your experience level.
2. **Position Yourself**: Stand inside the machine, placing your back against the pad. Feet should be shoulder-width apart on the platform.

## Grip
- **Hand Position**: Grasp the handles or the designated grip area. Your arms should be straight down at your sides.

## Starting Position
- **Posture**: Engage your core, keep your back straight, and shoulders relaxed.
- **Initial Adjustment**: Ensure your shoulders are just below the shoulder pads.

## Execution
1. **Lift Shoulders**: Inhale and lift your shoulders upward as high as possible, focusing on squeezing your trapezius muscles.
2. **Pause**: Hold the contracted position for a moment at the top of the movement.
3. **Lower Shoulders**: Exhale as you slowly return your shoulders to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Avoid Leaning Forward or Back**: Keep your torso stationary throughout the movement to isolate the trapezius muscles.
- **Controlled Movement**: Focus on smooth, controlled lifts and lowers to maximize tension in the muscle.
- **Breathing**: Inhale during the lift, exhale during the lower.

## Common Mistakes
- **Using Momentum**: Do not use your arms or body to lift; focus on using only your shoulders.
- **Excessive Weight**: Lifting too much can lead to improper form and injury; ensure you can maintain proper technique throughout the movement.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Leverage Machine Shrug and target your trapezius muscles efficiently.
