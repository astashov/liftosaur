**Starting Position:**
- Stand with feet shoulder-width apart or sit on the edge of a bench.
- Hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
- Hinge at the hips, bending forward while keeping your back straight.
- Let the dumbbells hang straight down from your shoulders.

**Execution:**
1. **Engage Core:** Maintain a neutral spine and engage your core for stability.
2. **Raise Dumbbells:** With a slight bend in your elbows, lift the dumbbells out to the side until they are in line with your shoulders.
3. **Control Movement:** Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
4. **Lower Weights:** Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

**Breathing:**
- Exhale as you lift the dumbbells.
- Inhale as you lower them back down.

**Tips:**
- Keep movements smooth and controlled to prevent momentum.
- Avoid lifting weights that are too heavy; focus on form over weight.
- Keep your neck relaxed and avoid shrugging your shoulders.

### Set Up Your Position
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart or sit on a bench edge. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. Hinge at the hips with back straight so dumbbells hang below your shoulders.

### Engage Core

### Raise Dumbbells Outward
With a slight bend in your elbows, lift the dumbbells out to the sides until they are in line with your shoulders, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.

### Lower Slowly
Return the dumbbells to the starting position under control, exhaling as you lift and inhaling as you lower.
