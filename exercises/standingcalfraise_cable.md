## Equipment Needed
- Cable machine
- Ankle strap attachment (optional)

## Setup
1. **Adjust Cable Machine**: Set the pulley at the lowest position.
2. **Attach Strap**: If using an ankle strap, attach it to the low pulley.
3. **Position**: Stand facing away from the cable machine, with feet hip-width apart, and attach the strap to one ankle.

## Execution
1. **Initial Position**: Stand tall with your legs straight and shoulders relaxed. Hold onto the machine or a stable surface for support if needed.
2. **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight for balance.
3. **Raise Heels**: Push through the balls of your feet to lift your heels off the ground. Ensure your toes remain in contact with the floor.
4. **Full Extension**: Raise your heels until you feel a stretch in your calves at the top of the movement.
5. **Lower**: Slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position, controlling the movement to avoid bouncing.

## Tips
- **Posture**: Maintain a straight torso throughout; avoid leaning forward or backward.
- **Range of Motion**: Focus on a full range of motion without compromising form.
- **Breathing**: Exhale on the upward movement and inhale while lowering.

## Common Mistakes
- Bouncing at the bottom or top of the movement.
- Letting the knees overextend or locking them.
- Slouching or leaning forward excessively.
