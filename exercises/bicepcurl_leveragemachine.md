### Steps for Proper Form

1. **Setup the Machine**:
   - Adjust the seat height so that your upper arms rest comfortably against the padded arms of the machine.
   - Select an appropriate weight.

2. **Position Your Body**:
   - Sit with your back flat against the backrest.
   - Keep your feet planted flat on the floor, about shoulder-width apart.

3. **Grip the Handles**:
   - Grab the handles with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
   - Ensure your elbows are locked in position and aligned with the machine's pivot point.

4. **Start the Curl**:
   - Begin with your arms fully extended. Exhale as you curl the handles toward your shoulders.
   - Focus on squeezing your biceps at the top of the movement.

5. **Control the Motion**:
   - Lower the handles back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
   - Inhale as you lower the weights, maintaining tension in the biceps throughout.

6. **Keep Proper Posture**:
   - Avoid leaning forward or backward during the movement.
   - Keep your elbows stationary and close to your body.

### Tips for Optimal Form
- Do not use momentum to lift the weights; rely solely on your biceps.
- Ensure a smooth and fluid motion throughout the exercise.
- Monitor your body alignment to prevent any strain on your back or shoulders.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Lifting weights that are too heavy, leading to improper form.
- Allowing elbows to flare out or shift during the movement.
- Using excessive body movement or swinging to perform the curl.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Leverage Machine Bicep Curl with proper form, maximizing your bicep development while minimizing the risk of injury.

### Adjust and Sit Down
Set the seat so your upper arms rest comfortably on the machine's padded supports. Sit with your back flat against the backrest and feet planted on the floor.

### Grip and Align Elbows
Grab the handles with an underhand grip (palms up) and ensure your elbows are aligned with the machine's pivot point. This position eliminates momentum and isolates the biceps.

### Curl to Full Contraction
Exhale as you curl the handles toward your shoulders. Squeeze the biceps firmly at the top of the movement without leaning forward or backward.

### Lower with Bicep Tension
Slowly lower the handles back to the starting position while inhaling. Maintain tension in the biceps throughout the descent without letting the weight stack drop.
