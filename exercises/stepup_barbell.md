## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and a sturdy bench or step.
2. **Positioning**: Place the barbell across your upper back, similar to a squat position. Feet shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Stand in front of the bench, facing it. 
2. **Step Up**: Lift one foot and place it firmly on the bench. Ensure the entire foot is in contact.
3. **Drive Up**: Push through the heel of the foot on the bench to lift your body up. Keep the other foot hovering just above the ground.
4. **Top Position**: Stand tall at the top of the step, maintaining balance. Engage your core.
5. **Step Down**: Lower back down by bending your knee and controlling the movement. Step down with the same foot you used to step up.
6. **Repeat**: Alternate legs after completing the desired repetitions.

## Tips
- Keep your back straight and chest up throughout the movement.
- Avoid leaning forward; maintain an upright torso.
- Choose a bench height that allows for a comfortable range of motion.
