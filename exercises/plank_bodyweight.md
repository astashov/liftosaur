## Starting Position
1. **Get down** on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips.
2. **Extend your legs** back, one foot at a time, until your body is in a straight line from head to heels.

## Proper Form
- **Hand Placement**: Keep your hands shoulder-width apart, fingers facing forward or slightly outward.
- **Body Alignment**: Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels. Avoid sagging your hips or lifting your buttocks too high.
- **Core Engagement**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to support your spine.
- **Neck Position**: Keep your head neutral, looking slightly ahead rather than up or down.
- **Breathing**: Breathe steadily through your nose, avoiding holding your breath.

## Common Mistakes
- **Dropping Hips**: Maintain a straight line; do not let your hips sag.
- **Raising Shoulders**: Keep your shoulders directly over your wrists to prevent strain.
- **Holding Tension**: Relax your jaw and shoulders to avoid tension buildup.

## Variations
- **Knee Plank**: Perform with knees on the ground to reduce intensity.
- **Plank on Forearms**: Rest on your forearms instead of hands for a different challenge.

## Duration
Aim to hold the plank position for a sustainable amount of time, gradually increasing as you build strength and endurance.
