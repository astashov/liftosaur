### Setup:
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band.
2. **Positioning**: Stand on the band with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the ends of the band in each hand.

### Execution:
1. **Grip**: Maintain a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
2. **Starting Position**: Arms by your sides, elbows close to your body.
3. **Curling Motion**: Flex your elbows to raise your hands towards your shoulders while keeping your elbows stationary.
4. **Control**: Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement.
5. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower back to starting position, resisting the band's tension.

### Key Points:
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning forward.
- Engage your core for stability.
- Maintain control throughout the movement, avoiding any jerky motions.
