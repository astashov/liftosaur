---

**Objective:** Strengthen wrist flexors and extensors.

### Instructions:

1. **Equipment Setup:** 
   - Use a sturdy bar, beam, or gymnastic rings that can support your body weight.
   - Optionally, have a small towel or rope tied with a weight at one end to create resistance.

2. **Starting Position:**
   - Grip the bar or beam with both hands, palms facing down (overhand grip).
   - Hang vertically so your arms are fully extended and body is straight.

3. **Engaging Core:**
   - Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your torso.

4. **Wrist Movement:**
   - Slowly roll the bar or towel up using only your wrists.
   - Keep your forearms stationary, focusing on wrist motion.

5. **Reset Position:**
   - Once the weight is fully rolled up, slowly lower it back to the starting position by unwinding your wrists.

6. **Maintain Form:**
   - Keep your elbows close to your body throughout the movement.
   - Avoid swinging or using momentum; maintain control.

7. **Breathing:**
   - Exhale while rolling up, inhale while rolling down.

#### Tips:
- Start with lighter resistance to master the form.
- If using a towel or rope, adjust the weight based on your ability.
- Keep your movements slow and controlled for maximum effectiveness. 

#### Common Mistakes:
- Using your body to assist the movement rather than isolating the wrists.
- Allowing elbows to flare out.
- Rolling too quickly, compromising form. 

With practice, this exercise can significantly improve wrist strength and stability.

### Set Up Equipment
Grip a bar with both hands in an overhand grip. Optionally attach a rope or towel with a weight at one end for added resistance.

### Engage and Stabilize
Hang vertically with arms fully extended and core tight. Keep your elbows close to your body throughout the movement.

### Roll Up
Slowly roll the bar or towel upward using only your wrist motion, keeping your forearms stationary and avoiding body swaying.

### Unwind Back Down
Once fully rolled up, slowly lower the weight back to the starting position by unwinding your wrists in a controlled manner.
