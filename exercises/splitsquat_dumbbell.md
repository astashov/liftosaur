description: "Build unilateral leg strength with the Dumbbell Split Squat, lowering into a staggered stance with dumbbells to target the quads, glutes, and hamstrings."
---

**Setup:**
1. Stand upright with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides.
2. Step one foot back into a split stance; the back heel should be lifted, and both feet should be shoulder-width apart. 

**Execution:**
1. Lower your body by bending both knees, keeping your front knee aligned over your ankle.
2. Descend until your back knee nearly touches the ground.
3. Ensure your torso remains upright and core engaged throughout the movement.
4. Push through the front heel to return to the starting position.

**Tips:**
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning forward.
- Control your descent and ascent to maintain balance.
- Perform the exercise evenly on both legs. 

**Common Mistakes:**
- Allowing the front knee to extend past the toes.
- Excessive leaning or rounding of the back.
- Using weights that are too heavy to maintain proper form. 

**Variations:**
- Perform with a rear foot elevated on a bench for added range of motion.
- Use a single dumbbell held in the goblet position for a different challenge. 

Focus on maintaining correct posture and control throughout the exercise for maximum effectiveness and safety.

### Set Up with Dumbbells
Stand upright holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides. Step one foot back into a split stance with the rear heel lifted and feet roughly shoulder-width apart.

### Lower into the Split Squat
Bend both knees to descend, keeping your front knee aligned over your ankle. Lower until the back knee nearly touches the ground while maintaining an upright torso.

### Press Through the Front Heel

### Complete Reps and Switch
Finish all reps on one side before switching legs. Control both the descent and ascent to maximize muscle engagement and prevent injury.
