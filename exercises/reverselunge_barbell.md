### Setup
1. **Barbell Position**: Place a barbell on your upper back, similar to a back squat, grip it with both hands.

2. **Stand Tall**: Feet shoulder-width apart and engage your core.

#### Execution
1. **Step Back**: Take a step back with one foot, lowering your knee toward the floor while keeping the front knee directly above your ankle.

2. **Lower Your Body**: Bend both knees to lower into the lunge. The back knee should hover just above the ground.

3. **Front Foot Pressure**: Press through the heel of your front foot to initiate the movement back to the starting position.

4. **Return**: Bring your back leg forward to return to a standing position.

5. **Alternate**: Switch legs and repeat the movement.

#### Tips for Proper Form
- **Back Straight**: Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning forward.
- **Knees in Line**: Ensure your knees do not cave in; they should follow the direction of your toes.
- **Foot Placement**: Maintain a stable foot placement, ensuring the front heel remains planted.
- **Control**: Focus on a controlled movement both during the descent and ascent.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Leaning Forward**: This can strain your back; maintain an upright posture.
- **Neglecting Back Knee**: Don't let your back knee touch the ground forcefully; control the movement.
- **Turning Feet Out**: Keep your toes pointing forward to protect your knees.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Barbell Reverse Lunge effectively and safely.
