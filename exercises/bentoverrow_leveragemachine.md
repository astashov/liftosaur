## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Set the seat of the leverage machine so that your torso is parallel to the ground when you sit down.
2. **Foot Placement**: Position your feet securely on the machine footrest or ground.

## Execution
1. **Grip the Handles**: Grasp the handles with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
2. **Position Your Body**: Lean forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
3. **Pull the Handles**: 
   - Begin by retracting your shoulder blades.
   - Pull the handles towards your lower rib cage, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4. **Squeeze at the Top**: Hold the contracted position for a moment while squeezing your back muscles.
5. **Lower the Weight**: Slowly return the handles to the starting position while maintaining control.

## Form Tips
- **Keep Your Back Straight**: Avoid rounding your back throughout the movement.
- **Engage Your Core**: This helps stabilize your body and protect your lower back.
- **Breathe**: Exhale while pulling the handles; inhale as you lower them.

## Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back.
- Using too much momentum instead of control.
- Letting elbows drift out too wide.
