### Setup

2. **Position**: Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Loop the band around the soles of your feet and hold an end in each hand.

### Execution

2. **Grip**: Hold the band with your palms facing each other or facing down, depending on your preference.
3. **Row Movement**:
   - Pull the band towards your waist by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
   - Keep your elbows close to your body and avoid leaning back.
4. **End Position**: Hold for a moment when your hands reach your torso, ensuring your back remains straight.
  
### Return
1. **Release**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control and tension in the band.

### Tips
- **Breathing**: Exhale while pulling the band towards you and inhale as you extend your arms.

- **Focus**: Maintain tension in the band throughout the entire range of motion.

### Common Mistakes
