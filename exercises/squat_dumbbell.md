## Starting Position
1. **Stand Tall**: Feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward.
2. **Hold Dumbbells**: Grasp a dumbbell in each hand by your sides or at shoulder level (goblet position).

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your torso.
2. **Hip Hinge**: Push your hips back as if sitting in a chair. Keep your chest upright.
3. **Squat Down**: Bend your knees while keeping your back straight. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor or slightly below.
4. **Knees Alignment**: Ensure your knees track over your toes and do not cave inward.
5. **Press Through Heels**: Drive through your heels to rise back to standing, fully extending your hips and knees at the top.

## Tips
- **Maintain Neutral Spine**: Keep your back straight throughout the movement.
- **Avoid Lifting Heels**: Keep your heels flat on the ground.
- **Controlled Movements**: Focus on smooth, controlled descent and ascent.

## Common Mistakes
- **Knees Caving In**: Ensure knees track properly.
- **Leaning Forward**: Keep your torso upright to avoid back strain.
- **Incomplete Range of Motion**: Aim for full depth within your comfort limits.
