## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a safety squat bar (SSB) and a squat rack.
2. **Position the Bar**: Adjust the bar to shoulder height in the squat rack.

## Execution
1. **Approach**: Stand facing the bar, elbows underneath the pads.
2. **Grip**: Grasp the handles with a neutral grip.
3. **Positioning**: Step back into a stable stance, feet shoulder-width apart.
4. **Engage Core**: Brace your core for stability.

## The Squat
1. **Descent**: Lower your body by bending at the hips and knees, keeping your chest up and back straight. 
2. **Depth**: Aim to go down until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground, depending on your mobility.
3. **Knees**: Ensure knees track over your toes and do not cave inward.

## Ascent
1. **Push Through Heels**: Drive through the heels to rise back up.
2. **Straighten Up**: Fully extend your hips and knees until you return to a standing position.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Focus on controlled movements, avoiding bouncing at the bottom.
- Keep your head in a neutral position, looking ahead. 

## Breathing
- Inhale as you lower yourself down.
- Exhale as you push back up to standing.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing knees to cave in.
- Rounding the back during the descent.
- Lifting the heels off the ground.
