### Starting Position
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band.
2. **Feet Position**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Step on the center of the band and hold the ends with both hands.
3. **Grip**: Hold the band with an overhand grip, arms fully extended in front of you.

### Execution
1. **Raise**: Pull the band upward towards your chin, leading with your elbows. Your elbows should be above your wrists.
2. **Body Position**: Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
3. **Movement Path**: The band should follow a straight line from the starting position to your chin.
4. **Control**: Lower the band back to the starting position in a controlled manner, ensuring not to let your shoulders drop.

### Tips
- Avoid using excessive momentum; the movement should be smooth and controlled.
- Keep your elbows pointed outwards and avoid letting them drop below wrist height.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position, preventing any bending at the wrists.

### Common Mistakes
- Pulling too high, which can lead to shoulder strain.
- Arching the back or leaning forward.
- Using too much body sway or momentum instead of isolating the shoulder muscles.

Maintain proper form throughout the exercise to maximize effectiveness and prevent injury.
