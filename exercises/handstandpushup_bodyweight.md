## Setup
1. **Start Position**: Face a wall for support. Kick into a handstand position with your back against the wall.
2. **Hand Placement**: Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the ground, about 6-12 inches from the wall.

## Execution
1. **Body Alignment**: Keep your body straight from head to heels, engaging your core and glutes.
2. **Lowering Phase**: Bend your elbows to lower your head towards the ground. Keep elbows close to your body.
3. **Depth**: Aim for your head to touch or come close to the ground.
4. **Pushing Phase**: Press through your palms to push back up to the starting position while keeping a tight core.

## Key Points
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower your body; exhale when pushing back up.
- **Control**: Avoid letting your feet or legs sag. Maintain a straight line.
- **Wall Support**: Use the wall for balance; don't rely on it to push up.

## Tips
- Work on shoulder strength and flexibility beforehand.
- If new to the movement, practice partial range of motion first.
- Ensure a strong base with a proper grip on the ground.
