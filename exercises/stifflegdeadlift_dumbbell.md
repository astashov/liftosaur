### Starting Position
1. **Stand** with feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand, arms fully extended in front of your thighs.
2. **Engage your core** to maintain stability.

### Execution
1. **Hinge at the hips**: Slightly bend your knees and push your hips back while keeping your back straight.
2. **Lower the dumbbells**: Allow the weights to slide down your legs, keeping them close to your body. Focus on maintaining a flat back.
3. **Feel the stretch**: Go as low as your flexibility allows without rounding your back—aim for a stretch in the hamstrings.
4. **Return to starting position**: Squeeze your glutes and drive your hips forward to rise back to the starting position, maintaining a flat back.

### Key Points
- Keep your head neutral with your spine.
- Do not round your back; maintain a straight spine throughout.
- Move in a controlled manner to avoid injury.
