### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a single handle attachment.
2. **Position**: Stand facing the cable machine with feet shoulder-width apart.
3. **Adjustment**: Set the pulley to the lowest position.

### Execution
1. **Grip**: Grab the handle with an overhand grip (palms facing down).
2. **Starting Position**: Step back slightly to create tension in the cable. Hold the handle at thigh level with your arm extended downwards.
3. **Raise**: Keep your arm straight and raise the handle in front of you to shoulder height. Your torso should remain upright and stable.
4. **Control**: Slowly lower the handle back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.

### Tips
- **Breathing**: Exhale while raising the handle and inhale while lowering it.
- **Wrist Position**: Keep your wrists neutral and avoid bending them.
- **Engagement**: Focus on engaging your shoulder muscles rather than using momentum.
- **Body Position**: Avoid leaning back; keep your core tight to maintain stability.

### Common Mistakes
- Raising the weights too high beyond shoulder height.
- Using excessive body momentum to lift the cable.
- Not maintaining a straight arm throughout the movement. 

Following this form will help maximize the effectiveness of the Cable Front Raise while minimizing the risk of injury.

### Set Up the Cable
Attach a single handle to the lowest pulley position. Stand facing the cable machine with feet shoulder-width apart and grip the handle with an overhand grip.

### Create Tension
Step back slightly so the cable is taut with your arm hanging extended downward. Keep your torso upright and core engaged throughout.

### Raise to Shoulder Height
Keep your arm straight and raise the handle in front of you to shoulder level. Exhale as you lift and avoid leaning back or using momentum.

### Lower Under Control
Slowly return the handle to the starting position in a controlled manner. Inhale on the descent and keep your wrist neutral throughout the movement.
