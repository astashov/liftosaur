### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a single handle attachment.
2. **Position**: Stand facing the cable machine with feet shoulder-width apart.
3. **Adjustment**: Set the pulley to the lowest position.

### Execution
1. **Grip**: Grab the handle with an overhand grip (palms facing down).
2. **Starting Position**: Step back slightly to create tension in the cable. Hold the handle at thigh level with your arm extended downwards.
3. **Raise**: Keep your arm straight and raise the handle in front of you to shoulder height. Your torso should remain upright and stable.
4. **Control**: Slowly lower the handle back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.

### Tips
- **Breathing**: Exhale while raising the handle and inhale while lowering it.
- **Wrist Position**: Keep your wrists neutral and avoid bending them.
- **Engagement**: Focus on engaging your shoulder muscles rather than using momentum.
- **Body Position**: Avoid leaning back; keep your core tight to maintain stability.

### Common Mistakes
- Raising the weights too high beyond shoulder height.
- Using excessive body momentum to lift the cable.
- Not maintaining a straight arm throughout the movement.
