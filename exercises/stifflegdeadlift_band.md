### Setup
1. **Equipment Needed**: Resistance band and a flat surface.
2. **Position the Band**: Step on the band with both feet, placing it under the mid-foot. Hold the ends in each hand, arms fully extended.

#### Execution
1. **Initial Stance**: Stand tall with feet hip-width apart, back straight, and shoulders back. Hold the band with palms facing the body.
2. **Hinge at Hips**: Push your hips back while maintaining a slight bend in the knees. Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout.
3. **Lower the Band**: Allow the band to lower towards the ground, keeping it close to the body. Go down until you feel a stretch in the hamstrings.
4. **Return to Start**: Engage your glutes and hamstrings to push through your heels, returning to the starting position while keeping the back straight.

#### Tips
- Focus on hinging at the hips, not bending at the waist.
- Keep the band taut—avoid slack.
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Control the movement; avoid jerking or using momentum.
