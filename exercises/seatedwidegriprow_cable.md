## Starting Position
1. **Adjust the Cable Machine:** Set the pulley to a low position.
2. **Attach the Bar:** Use a wide grip bar attachment.
3. **Sit Down:** Position yourself on the bench with your feet flat on the platform.
4. **Grip the Bar:** Hold the bar with an overhand grip, your hands wider than shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Posture:** Sit up straight with your back neutral and chest lifted.
2. **Engage Core:** Tighten your abdominal muscles to support your spine.
3. **Pull the Bar:** Initiate the movement by pulling the bar towards your torso, leading with your elbows.
4. **Squeeze Shoulders:** Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
5. **Return Slowly:** Extend your arms back to the starting position in a controlled manner, avoiding momentum.

## Tips
- Maintain a slight bend in your knees throughout the exercise.
- Avoid rounding your back or leaning too far backward.
- Keep your shoulders down, avoiding shrugging as you pull.
- Concentrate on a fluid motion for both pulling and returning the bar.
