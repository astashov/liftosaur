### Setup
1. **Position the Bench**: Adjust the bench to a decline angle (about 15-30 degrees). Secure it in a Smith machine.
2. **Load the Bar**: Choose an appropriate weight and place it on the Smith machine bar.

### Starting Position
1. **Lying Down**: Lie on the decline bench with your head at the lower end and feet secured.
2. **Grip the Bar**: Use a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip. Ensure your palms face away from you.

### Execution
1. **Initial Lift**: Unrack the bar by rotating it forward. Hold it at chest level with extended arms.
2. **Lower the Bar**: Control the descent of the bar towards your lower chest, ensuring elbows remain at about a 45-degree angle from your body.
3. **Pause**: Briefly stop just above your chest to maintain tension.
4. **Press Up**: Push the bar back to the starting position by extending your arms fully while keeping your feet flat on the ground.

### Key Points
- **Maintain Alignment**: Keep your wrists straight and elbows slightly tucked to avoid strain.
- **Controlled Movement**: Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest; focus on smooth, controlled movements.
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the bar and exhale as you press it upward.

### Safety Tips
- **Use a Spotter**: If lifting heavy, have a spotter for safety.
- **Check Locking Mechanism**: Ensure the bar is secure in the Smith machine before starting.

### Common Mistakes
- **Excessive Arching**: Avoid excessive arch in your lower back; maintain a neutral spine.
- **Too Wide Grip**: A grip that's too wide can strain your shoulders; keep it shoulder-width or slightly wider.

### Lower to the Lower Chest
Control the descent of the bar toward your lower chest, keeping elbows at about 45 degrees from your torso. Pause just above your chest without bouncing.
