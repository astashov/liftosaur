### Setup
1. **Position the Bench**: Adjust the bench to a decline angle (about 15-30 degrees). Secure it in a Smith machine.
2. **Load the Bar**: Choose an appropriate weight and place it on the Smith machine bar.

### Starting Position
1. **Lying Down**: Lie on the decline bench with your head at the lower end and feet secured.
2. **Grip the Bar**: Use a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip. Ensure your palms face away from you.

### Execution
1. **Initial Lift**: Unrack the bar by rotating it forward. Hold it at chest level with extended arms.
2. **Lower the Bar**: Control the descent of the bar towards your lower chest, ensuring elbows remain at about a 45-degree angle from your body.
3. **Pause**: Briefly stop just above your chest to maintain tension.
4. **Press Up**: Push the bar back to the starting position by extending your arms fully while keeping your feet flat on the ground.

### Key Points
- **Maintain Alignment**: Keep your wrists straight and elbows slightly tucked to avoid strain.
- **Controlled Movement**: Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest; focus on smooth, controlled movements.
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the bar and exhale as you press it upward.

### Safety Tips
- **Use a Spotter**: If lifting heavy, have a spotter for safety.
- **Check Locking Mechanism**: Ensure the bar is secure in the Smith machine before starting.

### Common Mistakes
- **Excessive Arching**: Avoid excessive arch in your lower back; maintain a neutral spine.
- **Too Wide Grip**: A grip that's too wide can strain your shoulders; keep it shoulder-width or slightly wider.
