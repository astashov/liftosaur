## Starting Position
1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold your arms at a 90-degree angle, elbows slightly below shoulder level.
3. Keep your core engaged and maintain a neutral spine.

## Execution
1. **Dip:** Slightly bend your knees (about 1-2 inches) to initiate the movement.
2. **Drive:** Extend your legs explosively while simultaneously pushing your arms up.
3. **Press:** Raise your hands above your head, fully extending your arms.
4. **Return:** Lower your arms back to the starting position, absorbing the movement with a slight bend in the knees.

## Key Points
- Maintain a tight core throughout the movement.
- Keep your head neutral; avoid leaning back.
- Ensure that your movement is fluid, synchronizing the leg drive with your arm press.
- Focus on an explosive upward movement for maximum effect.
