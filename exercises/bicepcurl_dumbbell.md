**Starting Position:**
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with arms fully extended and palms facing forward.

**Execution:**
1. Keep your elbows close to your torso.
2. Curl the dumbbells upward by bending your elbows while contracting your biceps.
3. Raise the dumbbells until they are at shoulder level, ensuring that your upper arms remain stationary.
4. Squeeze the biceps at the top of the movement.

**Return:**
1. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position while controlling the motion.
2. Ensure the elbows stay in place as you lower the weights.

**Tips for Proper Form:**
- Avoid swinging or using momentum; focus on controlled movement.
- Keep your wrists neutral; don’t allow them to bend.
- Maintain a straight back; avoid leaning or arching.

This exercise targets the biceps effectively when done with proper form.
