### Starting Position
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grip the barbell with both hands, slightly narrower than shoulder-width.
3. Hold the barbell in front of you at thigh level, palms facing your body.

### Execution
1. **Lift**: Pull the barbell straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
2. **Elbow Position**: Keep your elbows higher than your wrists throughout the movement.
3. **Body Position**: Maintain a straight back and avoid leaning backward. Keep your core engaged.
4. **Bar Path**: The bar should stay close to your body as you lift. 

### Peak Contraction
1. Raise the bar to about chest level or just below your chin.
2. Hold for a brief moment at the top of the movement.

### Lowering Phase
1. Lower the barbell back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
2. Fully extend your arms, returning to the thigh level.

### Tips
- Avoid using excessive weight that compromises form.
- Ensure your movements are smooth and controlled.
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise.

### Common Mistakes
- Lifting the bar too high (above chin level).
- Allowing the wrists to bend excessively.
- Using momentum instead of muscle engagement.
