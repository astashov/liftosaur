### Equipment Needed
- Cable machine with a low pulley and an adjustable handle.

### Instructions

1. **Setup:**
   - Attach a single handle to the low pulley on the cable machine.
   - Stand next to the machine, feet shoulder-width apart.

2. **Grip the Handle:**
   - Using the hand closest to the machine, grab the handle with an overhand grip.
   - Step away from the machine to create tension in the cable.

3. **Initial Position:**
   - Pull the handle up to your shoulder for stability.
   - Keep your other hand on your hip or extended for balance.

4. **Engage Your Core:**
   - Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your torso.

5. **Perform the Side Bend:**
   - Slowly bend at your waist to the side, bringing the handle down towards your knee while keeping your torso straight.
   - Avoid rotating your torso; keep the movement lateral.

6. **Return to Starting Position:**
   - Reverse the motion by engaging your oblique muscles to return to the upright position.

7. **Repetition:**
   - Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Maintain a straight back throughout the exercise.
- Keep your movements controlled to avoid injury.
- Focus on squeezing your oblique muscles during the contraction.
- Ensure the range of motion doesn’t cause discomfort in your lower back.

### Common Mistakes
- Allowing the torso to twist instead of bending sideways.
- Using momentum instead of muscle engagement.
- Not maintaining a stable base with the feet.

By following these steps and tips, you can effectively perform the Cable Side Bend with proper form, targeting your oblique muscles.
