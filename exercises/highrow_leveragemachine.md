### Setup
1. **Adjust Seat Height**: Ensure the seat is adjusted so that your arms can reach the handles comfortably without strain.
2. **Select Weight**: Choose an appropriate weight on the machine.

### Starting Position
1. **Sit Down**: Sit with your back against the pad, feet flat on the ground.
2. **Grip Handles**: Grasp the handles with a neutral grip (palms facing each other) or an overhand grip (palms facing down).
3. **Position Arms**: Hold your arms extended while keeping a slight bend in your elbows.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your torso.
2. **Pull Handles**: Drive your elbows back while pulling the handles towards your upper abdomen or chest.
3. **Maintain Posture**: Keep your chest up and shoulders down and back throughout the movement.
4. **Squeeze**: At the end of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.

### Return
1. **Control Movement**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control without letting the weights rest completely.
2. **Avoid Locking Elbows**: Ensure that your elbows don't lock out fully at the bottom; keep a slight bend.

### Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale during the controlled return phase; exhale when pulling the handles.
- **Focus on Muscle**: Concentrate on using your back muscles rather than your arms.
- **Avoid Momentum**: Ensure all movements are smooth and controlled, avoiding any swinging motions.
