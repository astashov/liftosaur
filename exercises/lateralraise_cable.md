description: "Develop lateral deltoids with the Cable Lateral Raise, standing side-on to a cable machine and raising your arm to shoulder height with constant tension."
---

**Starting Position:**
1. Adjust the pulleys to the lowest setting on a cable machine.
2. Stand side-on to the machine, grasping the handle with the hand closest to the machine.
3. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in your knees.
4. Stabilize your body by engaging your core and maintaining a neutral spine.

**Execution:**
1. Start with your arm down at your side, holding the cable handle.
2. With a slight bend in your elbow, raise your arm out to the side. Keep your arm parallel to the floor.
3. Focus on using your shoulder and lateral deltoid muscles to perform the raise.
4. Control the movement as you lift; avoid using momentum.

**Finishing Position:**
1. At the top of the movement, your arm should be at shoulder height.
2. Hold for a moment, then slowly lower your arm back to the starting position.
3. Maintain control throughout the descent.

**Tips:**
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid shrugging.
- Perform the exercise slowly to maximize tension on the muscles.
- Adjust the weight so that you can maintain proper form throughout the exercise.

### Set Up at the Cable Machine
Adjust the pulley to the lowest setting. Stand side-on to the machine with feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in your knees.

### Grip the Handle
Grasp the cable handle with the hand closest to the machine. Start with your arm hanging straight down at your side.

### Raise to Shoulder Height
With a slight bend in the elbow, raise your arm out to the side until it is parallel to the floor. Focus on using your lateral deltoid, not momentum.

### Lower Under Control
Slowly return your arm to the starting position, maintaining tension throughout. Avoid letting the weight stack drop freely.
