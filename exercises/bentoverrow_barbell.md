### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell.
2. **Stance**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. **Grip**: Bend at the hips and knees to lower your torso. Grip the barbell with both hands, slightly wider than shoulder-width, using an overhand grip.

### Positioning
1. **Hinge at Hips**: Keep your back straight and hinge at the hips until your torso is about 45 degrees to the ground.
2. **Knees**: Slightly bend your knees for stability.
3. **Brace Core**: Engage your core muscles to protect your lower back.

### Execution
1. **Pulling Motion**: Pull the barbell towards your lower ribcage, keeping your elbows close to your body.
2. **Squeeze Shoulder Blades**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together for maximum contraction.
3. **Lowering the Bar**: Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position while maintaining control.

### Tips
- Keep your head neutral, looking down slightly.
- Maintain a straight back; avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Ensure your hips remain in position; do not let them rise or drop excessively during the lift.

### Common Mistakes
- Rounding your back.
- Overextending your neck.
- Using momentum instead of controlled motion.

Maintain proper form throughout the exercise for effectiveness and to prevent injury.
