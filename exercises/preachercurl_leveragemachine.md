---

### Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Set the seat height so your elbows rest comfortably on the preacher pad.
2. **Select Weight**: Choose an appropriate weight on the machine.

### Execution
1. **Grip the Handles**: Hold the handles with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
2. **Position Your Arms**: Rest your upper arms against the preacher pad with your elbows aligned with the pivot point of the machine.
3. **Starting Position**: Begin with your arms fully extended, allowing for a slight bend in the elbows to prevent joint strain.
4. **Curl the Weight**: Engage your biceps and curl the weight upwards, keeping your elbows fixed on the pad and avoiding movement of the upper arms.
5. **Peak Contraction**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your biceps for a moment.
6. **Lower the Weight**: Gradually lower the weight back to the starting position, maintaining control through the motion.

### Tips
- **Avoid Swinging**: Keep the movement slow and controlled. Do not use momentum.
- **Breathe**: Exhale during the curl and inhale while lowering the weight.
- **Focus on Form**: Prioritize proper technique over heavier weights to minimize injury risk. 

### Common Mistakes
- Lifting too heavy, leading to improper form.
- Allowing the upper arms to move off the pad.
- Not fully extending the arms at the bottom of the movement. 

Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure an effective and safe preacher curl using a leverage machine.
