## Setup
1. **Positioning**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in one hand. 
2. **Grip**: Use a neutral grip (palms facing you) or rack position (kettlebell resting against your forearm) for better stability.

## Execution
1. **Step Back**: Take a step backward with one leg, bending both knees to lower your body. Keep your torso upright.
2. **Knee Alignment**: Ensure your front knee stays aligned over your ankle, not extending past your toes.
3. **Back Leg**: Lower your back knee towards the ground, keeping it close to the floor without touching it.
4. **Core Engagement**: Keep your core tight throughout the movement to maintain balance and support your spine.

## Return
1. **Drive Up**: Push through the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position.
2. **Alternate Sides**: Switch the kettlebell to the opposite hand or switch legs for balance.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering, exhale while returning to the starting position.
- **Foot Placement**: Ensure your feet are stable and hip-width apart when returning.
- **Focus**: Keep your gaze forward, avoiding looking down to maintain balance.

## Common Mistakes
- Leaning forward excessively
- Allowing the front knee to cave inward
- Not maintaining an upright torso

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Kettlebell Reverse Lunge with proper form.
