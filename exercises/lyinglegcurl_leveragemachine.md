## Setup
1. **Adjust the Machine**: Set the pad to rest just above your heels. Adjust the backrest so that your body is flat against it.
2. **Position Yourself**: Lie face down on the machine, ensuring your knees align with the pivot point.

## Execution
1. **Grip the Handles**: Hold onto the side handles for stability.
2. **Starting Position**: Keep your legs straight and your ankles positioned under the padded lever.
3. **Curl the Legs**: Bend your knees to lift the weighted lever towards your glutes. Keep your hips pressed against the pad.
4. **Pause**: At the top of the curl, squeeze your hamstrings for a moment.
5. **Lower the Weight**: Slowly extend your legs back to the starting position without letting the weight stack touch down.

## Tips
- **Maintain Control**: Avoid using momentum; focus on muscle contraction.
- **Avoid Overextension**: Do not hyperextend your lower back.
- **Breathing**: Exhale when curling up and inhale while lowering the weight.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting hips off the pad.
- Using too much weight, leading to poor form.
- Not completing the full range of motion. 

By following these steps, you'll maximize the effectiveness of the Lying Leg Curl while minimizing the risk of injury.
