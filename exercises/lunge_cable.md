## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a dual cable machine.
2. **Attachment**: Set the cable at a low point and attach a handle.
3. **Starting Position**: Stand facing away from the machine, feet shoulder-width apart, and grab the handle with the opposite hand.

## Execution
1. **Step Back**: Take a step back with one foot, keeping a slight bend in your front knee.
2. **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight to maintain balance.
3. **Lower Body**: Bend your front leg to lower into a lunge, ensuring your knee stays above your ankle.
4. **Cable Resistance**: Allow the cable to pull you back gently as you lunge.
5. **Return**: Push through your front heel to return to the starting position.
6. **Repeat**: Perform on one side before switching to the other leg.
