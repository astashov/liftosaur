### Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat:** Sit on the machine and adjust the seat height so that your arms are at chest level when grasping the handles.
2. **Position Yourself:** Place your back firmly against the padded backrest. Your feet should be flat on the floor.

### Grip
1. **Hold the Handles:** Grasp the handles with a neutral grip, palms facing each other.
2. **Elbow Position:** Keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the movement to reduce strain on your joints.

### Movement
1. **Starting Position:** Begin with your arms extended out to the sides, maintaining tension in your chest.
2. **Execution:** Slowly bring the handles together in a controlled manner, focusing on contracting your chest muscles.
3. **End Position:** Bring the handles close together without letting them touch, maintaining tension in your chest.

### Return
1. **Controlled Reversal:** Gradually return to the starting position, ensuring that your elbows remain slightly bent and that you feel a stretch in your chest.

### Tips
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you bring the handles together and inhale as you return to the starting position.
- **Focus on Form:** Keep your movements slow and controlled to maximize muscle engagement and minimize risk of injury.
- **Avoid Overextending:** Do not let the weights fall or swing; maintain a smooth, deliberate motion.

### Common Mistakes
- **Rushing the Movement:** Prioritize control over speed.
- **Using Too Much Weight:** Choose a weight that allows you to maintain proper form and avoid straining.

### Adjust and Sit
Set the seat height so your arms are at chest level when gripping the handles. Sit back firmly against the padded backrest with feet flat on the floor.

### Grip the Handles
Grasp the handles with a neutral grip, keeping elbows slightly bent. Begin with your arms extended out to the sides, maintaining tension in your chest.

### Bring the Handles Together
Slowly arc the handles together in a controlled motion, focusing on squeezing your chest muscles. Stop just before the handles touch to keep tension on the pectorals.

### Return to the Start
Gradually reverse the motion back to the starting position, feeling a stretch across the chest as your arms open. Exhale on the way in and inhale on the return.
