### Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat:** Sit on the machine and adjust the seat height so that your arms are at chest level when grasping the handles.
2. **Position Yourself:** Place your back firmly against the padded backrest. Your feet should be flat on the floor.

### Grip
1. **Hold the Handles:** Grasp the handles with a neutral grip, palms facing each other.
2. **Elbow Position:** Keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the movement to reduce strain on your joints.

### Movement
1. **Starting Position:** Begin with your arms extended out to the sides, maintaining tension in your chest.
2. **Execution:** Slowly bring the handles together in a controlled manner, focusing on contracting your chest muscles.
3. **End Position:** Bring the handles close together without letting them touch, maintaining tension in your chest.

### Return
1. **Controlled Reversal:** Gradually return to the starting position, ensuring that your elbows remain slightly bent and that you feel a stretch in your chest.

### Tips
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you bring the handles together and inhale as you return to the starting position.
- **Focus on Form:** Keep your movements slow and controlled to maximize muscle engagement and minimize risk of injury.
- **Avoid Overextending:** Do not let the weights fall or swing; maintain a smooth, deliberate motion.

### Common Mistakes
- **Rushing the Movement:** Prioritize control over speed.
- **Using Too Much Weight:** Choose a weight that allows you to maintain proper form and avoid straining.
