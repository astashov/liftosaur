### Equipment Needed
- Resistance band

### Setup
1. **Positioning the Band**: 
   - Loop a resistance band around your upper back, crossing it under your armpits. 
   - Secure both ends of the band to the ground using your hands or step on them.

2. **Starting Position**: 
   - Get into a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. 
   - Your body should form a straight line from head to heels.

### Execution
1. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Engage your core.
   - Bend your elbows to lower your body towards the ground. 
   - Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle relative to your torso.

2. **Bottom Position**:
   - Go down until your chest is just above the ground or as far as your range of motion allows.

3. **Pressing Phase**: 
   - Push through your palms and extend your elbows to raise your body back to the starting position. 
   - The resistance band will assist, providing extra support.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your head neutral and gaze slightly forward.
- Avoid arching your back; maintain a straight line from head to heels.
- Engage your glutes and legs to keep your body stable.
- Control the movement, avoiding any jerky motions.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Allowing hips to sag or rise excessively.
- Flared elbows; keep them close to your body.
- Not engaging the core, leading to poor stability.

### Modifications
- Use a lighter band for less resistance or a thicker band for more assistance.
- Perform on your knees for an easier variation. 

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform band push-ups with proper form, targeting your chest, shoulders, and triceps.
