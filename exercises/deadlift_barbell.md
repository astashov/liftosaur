## Setup
1. **Foot Position**: Stand with feet hip-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
2. **Bar Position**: The bar should be over the mid-foot. 

## Grip
1. **Hands**: Bend at the hips and knees to reach down.
2. **Grip**: Use a double overhand or mixed grip (one palm facing you, one away). Grab the bar just outside your knees.

## Body Position
1. **Back**: Keep your back straight and shoulders slightly in front of the bar.
2. **Hips**: Set your hips at a height that keeps your spine neutral. 

## Lift
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Push Through Your Heels**: Drive through your heels as you lift the bar, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
3. **Lower the Bar**: Keep the bar close to your body, extending your knees first, then your hips.

## Finish
1. **Stand Tall**: At the top, your shoulders should be back and chest up, avoiding hyperextension of the back.
2. **Control the Descent**: Reverse the movement by hinging at the hips and bending the knees to lower the bar back to the ground.

## Tips
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the movement.
- Avoid rounding your back.
- Maintain a neutral spine and avoid excessive arching or flexion.

### Position Over the Bar
Stand with feet hip-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward, and the bar over your mid-foot. Bend at hips and knees to grip the bar just outside your knees.

### Set Your Back
With your grip established, keep your back straight, chest up, and shoulders slightly in front of the bar. Engage your core and set your lats.

### Drive Through Your Heels
Push the floor away by extending your hips and knees simultaneously, keeping the bar close to your body as it rises. Your hips and shoulders should rise at the same rate.

### Stand Tall and Lower
At the top, stand with shoulders back and chest up without hyperextending. Reverse by hinging at the hips first, then bending the knees to lower the bar back to the floor.
