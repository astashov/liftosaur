## Setup
1. **Foot Position**: Stand with feet hip-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
2. **Bar Position**: The bar should be over the mid-foot. 

## Grip
1. **Hands**: Bend at the hips and knees to reach down.
2. **Grip**: Use a double overhand or mixed grip (one palm facing you, one away). Grab the bar just outside your knees.

## Body Position
1. **Back**: Keep your back straight and shoulders slightly in front of the bar.
2. **Hips**: Set your hips at a height that keeps your spine neutral. 

## Lift
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Push Through Your Heels**: Drive through your heels as you lift the bar, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
3. **Lower the Bar**: Keep the bar close to your body, extending your knees first, then your hips.

## Finish
1. **Stand Tall**: At the top, your shoulders should be back and chest up, avoiding hyperextension of the back.
2. **Control the Descent**: Reverse the movement by hinging at the hips and bending the knees to lower the bar back to the ground.

## Tips
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the movement.
- Avoid rounding your back.
- Maintain a neutral spine and avoid excessive arching or flexion.
