### Setup
1. Attach a straight bar or EZ-bar to the high pulley of a cable machine.
2. Stand or sit facing away from the machine, grasping the bar with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.

### Positioning
1. Step back slightly to create tension in the cable.
2. Lower the bar so that your arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor, elbows close to your head.

### Execution
1. Keeping your elbows stationary, bend them to lower the bar towards your forehead.
2. Ensure your upper arms remain close to your head, focusing on moving only at the elbows.
3. Lower the bar until your forearms are parallel to the floor or just above your forehead.

### Return
1. Extend your arms back to the starting position while maintaining tension in the triceps.
2. Avoid locking out your elbows at the top to keep tension on the muscles.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Focus on a controlled motion; avoid using momentum.
- Keep your core engaged for stability. 

### Common Mistakes
- Flaring elbows out; keep them tucked in.
- Using too much weight, compromising form.
- Not controlling the descent, leading to poor muscle engagement.

### Conclusion
Perform the Cable Skullcrusher with attention to form to effectively target the triceps while minimizing the risk of injury.
