## Setup
1. **Band Attachment**: Use a resistance band and secure it to a sturdy anchor at waist height on one side.
2. **Positioning**: Stand with your side facing the anchor point, holding the band with the hand closest to it. 

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Pull the band across your body, creating tension.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles.
3. **Movement**: 
   - Bend sideways at the waist towards the anchored side while keeping your hips stable.
   - Allow the band to pull you until you feel a stretch in your oblique muscles.
4. **Crunch Up**: Return to the starting position by pressing your hip back up and engaging your core.
5. **Transition**: Repeat for desired repetitions, then switch sides.

## Tips
- Maintain a straight posture throughout the movement.
- Avoid excessive leaning; focus on the side bending motion.
- Control the movement, avoiding any jerky motions.

### Anchor the Band
Secure a resistance band to a sturdy anchor at waist height on one side. Stand with your side facing the anchor, holding the band with the closest hand.

### Position and Brace
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and pull the band across your body to create tension. Tighten your core and keep your hips stable.

### Crunch Laterally
Bend sideways at the waist toward the anchored side, allowing the band to create resistance as you feel a stretch in the obliques.

### Return and Switch
Press your hip back up and engage your core to return to the starting position. Complete reps on this side, then switch to work the other oblique.
