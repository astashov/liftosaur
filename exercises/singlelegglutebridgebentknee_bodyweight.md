description: "Strengthen glutes with the Bodyweight Single Leg Glute Bridge Bent Knee, pressing through one heel to lift the hips while the opposite knee is held bent."
---

## Starting Position
1. Lie on your back on a mat.
2. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
3. Lift one leg off the ground, positioning the knee at a 90-degree angle (bent knee) while keeping the other foot planted.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and push through the heel of the planted foot to lift your hips off the ground.
2. As you lift, keep your buttocks and abdominal muscles tight.
3. Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knee of the raised leg.
4. Hold for a moment at the top of the movement.

## Lowering Phase
1. Slowly lower your hips back to the ground while maintaining control.
2. Ensure the knee of the raised leg remains aligned over the ankle without flaring outwards.

## Key Points
- Keep your upper back and shoulders on the mat throughout the movement.
- Focus on squeezing your glutes at the top of the bridge for maximum activation.
- Maintain a neutral spine; avoid overarching your lower back.
- Alternate legs after completing your desired number of repetitions.

## Common Mistakes
- Arching the back excessively.
- Letting the knee of the raised leg drift outward.
- Not fully engaging the glutes during the lift.

By maintaining proper form, you can effectively engage your glutes and improve strength in this exercise.
