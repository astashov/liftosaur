### Starting Position
1. **Lie Down**: Start by lying flat on your back on a mat or comfortable surface.
2. **Body Alignment**: Extend your arms straight above your head and legs straight on the floor, keeping your body in a straight line.

### Movement
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles.
2. **Lift**: Simultaneously raise your legs and upper body off the ground, bringing your arms towards your legs. Think of forming a 'V' shape with your body.
3. **Reach**: Aim to touch your toes or get as close as possible while keeping your legs straight.

### Return
1. **Lower Body**: Slowly lower your upper body and legs back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
2. **Maintain Control**: Avoid letting your back arch excessively and keep the movement smooth.

### Key Points
- **Breathing**: Exhale as you lift your body and inhale as you return to the starting position.
- **Keep Control**: Focus on maintaining stability throughout the movement.
- **Avoid Strain**: Do not pull on your neck; use your core muscles for movement. 

### Common Mistakes
- Lifting your head and neck too aggressively.
- Arching the back instead of engaging the core.
- Rushing through the exercise instead of performing it slowly and with control.

By following these instructions, you can effectively perform the Bodyweight Jackknife Sit Up with proper form.
