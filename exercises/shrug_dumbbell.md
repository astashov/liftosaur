## Starting Position
- Stand upright with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body.
- Feet should be shoulder-width apart, with a slight bend in the knees.

## Execution
1. **Engage Your Shoulders:** Begin by relaxing your arms at your sides and focusing on your shoulders.
2. **Lift Your Shoulders:** Raise your shoulders straight up towards your ears as high as possible. Keep your arms straight and allow the dumbbells to hang down.
3. **Hold the Contraction:** At the top of the movement, pause briefly to maximize muscle engagement.
4. **Lower Slowly:** Slowly lower your shoulders back to the starting position to complete one repetition.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Keep the Neck Neutral:** Avoid tilting your head forward or backward during the exercise.
- **Controlled Motion:** Perform the lift and lowering in a slow and controlled manner to prevent injury and maximize effectiveness.
- **Avoid Overextension:** Do not rotate or roll your shoulders; keep the movement vertical.
- **Breathe:** Inhale while raising your shoulders and exhale while lowering them.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting with your arms rather than your shoulders.
- Using momentum to lift the weights instead of controlled movement.
- Shrugging with a hunched back; maintain a straight posture. 

Following these guidelines will help you perform the Dumbbell Shrug effectively and safely.
