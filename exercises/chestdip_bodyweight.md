### Starting Position
1. Find parallel bars or a dip station.
2. Grip the bars with your palms facing inward, arms fully extended.
3. Keep your body upright, feet together, and legs straight or slightly bent.

### Execution
1. **Lowering Phase**
   - Bend your elbows to lower your body.
   - Keep elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body.
   - Lean slightly forward to engage the chest.

2. **Depth**
   - Lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
   - Ensure your shoulders do not rise above your elbows.

3. **Raising Phase**
   - Push through your palms to lift your body back to the starting position.
   - Keep your core engaged and body stable throughout the movement.

### Breathing
- Inhale as you lower your body.
- Exhale as you push back up.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Avoid swinging or using momentum.
- Keep shoulders down and away from your ears.
- Maintain a controlled pace for each rep.
- If you feel discomfort in the shoulders, adjust your form or consider a different exercise. 

### Common Mistakes
- Flaring elbows out too much.
- Not going low enough for effective engagement.
- Arching the back excessively; maintain a neutral spine. 

By following these steps, you can perform the bodyweight chest dip effectively and safely.
