   - Bend your elbows to lower your body.
   - Keep elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body.
   - Lean slightly forward to engage the chest.

2. **Depth**
   - Lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
   - Ensure your shoulders do not rise above your elbows.

3. **Raising Phase**
   - Push through your palms to lift your body back to the starting position.
   - Keep your core engaged and body stable throughout the movement.

### Breathing
- Inhale as you lower your body.
- Exhale as you push back up.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Avoid swinging or using momentum.
- Keep shoulders down and away from your ears.
- Maintain a controlled pace for each rep.
- If you feel discomfort in the shoulders, adjust your form or consider a different exercise.
