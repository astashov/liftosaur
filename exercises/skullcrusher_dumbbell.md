## Starting Position
1. **Lie on a Bench**: Position yourself on a flat bench, ensuring your head, shoulders, and back are supported.
2. **Grip the Dumbbells**: Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing each other. Extend your arms straight above your chest.

## Execution
1. **Lower the Dumbbells**: Bend your elbows to lower the dumbbells towards your forehead, keeping your upper arms stationary.
2. **Maintain Control**: Ensure your elbows stay close to your head and do not flare out. Lower to a comfortable range without straining.
3. **Return to Start**: Press the dumbbells back up, extending your arms fully while squeezing your triceps at the top.

## Tips
- **Neutral Wrist Position**: Keep your wrists straight to avoid strain.
- **Breath Control**: Inhale as you lower the weights, exhale as you lift them.
- **Focus on Form**: Prioritize movement quality over weight to prevent injury.

## Common Mistakes
- Flaring elbows: Keep them tucked in throughout the movement.
- Using momentum: Move slowly and deliberately to ensure muscle engagement.
