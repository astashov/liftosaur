### Equipment Needed:
- Resistance band

### Steps:
1. **Setup**: 
   - Place the resistance band just above your knees.
   - Stand with your feet hip-width apart.

2. **Position**: 
   - Shift your weight to one leg (let's say the right leg).
   - Slightly bend your right knee and keep your left leg straight.

3. **Movement**: 
   - Engage your core for stability.
   - Slowly lift your left leg sideways, keeping it straight and toes pointed forward.
   - Focus on using your hip muscles to perform the movement.

4. **Return**:
   - Lower your left leg back to the starting position in a controlled manner.

5. **Repetitions**:
   - Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other leg.

### Tips:
- Maintain a straight posture throughout.
- Avoid leaning to the side as you lift your leg.
- Ensure the movement is slow and controlled to maximize effectiveness.
- Focus on squeezing your glutes at the top of the lift. 

### Benefits:
- Targets hip abductors, improving strength and stability.
- Enhances overall lower body function.
