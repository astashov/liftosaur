### Set Up the Machine
Adjust the cable to waist height and select an appropriate weight. Stand facing the machine and grasp the handle with both hands.

### Establish Your Stance
Position your feet shoulder-width apart with knees slightly bent. Engage your core and maintain an upright posture throughout the movement.

### Rotate Away
Keeping your hips stable, rotate your torso away from the machine while extending your arms. Feel the contraction build through your obliques at the end of the twist.

### Return Under Control
Reverse the rotation slowly and with control back to the starting position. Inhale on the return and exhale as you twist into each rep.
