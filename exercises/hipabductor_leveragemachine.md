## Equipment
- Leverage Hip Abductor Machine

## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Sit on the machine and adjust the seat height so your knees align with the pivot point of the machine.
2. **Adjust the Pads**: Position the outer pads against your thighs, just above your knees.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Sit with your back against the padded support and feet flat on the ground. Ensure your knees are close together.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles for stability.
3. **Abduction Movement**: Push your knees outward against the resistance, focusing on the hip abductor muscles.
4. **Maximum Range**: Continue to push until your knees are at a comfortable distance apart, ensuring you feel tension without strain.
5. **Return**: Slowly return to the starting position without letting the weights rest completely. Maintain tension in the muscles.

## Key Points
- Keep your back flat against the machine.
- Avoid using momentum; the movement should be controlled.
- Focus on squeezing your glutes and outer thighs throughout the exercise.
- Remember to breathe; exhale while pushing outward and inhale while returning.

## Common Mistakes
- Arching the back: Maintain a neutral spine.
- Not controlling the movement: Avoid fast, jerking motions.
- Allowing the knees to collapse inward on the return phase.

## Safety Tips
- Start with light resistance to master form.
- Avoid locking your knees during the movement.
- Listen to your body; if you feel pain, stop the exercise.
