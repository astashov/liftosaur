### Setup
1. **Anchor the Band**: Secure a resistance band at a high point above head level.
2. **Get Into Position**: Kneel on a mat in front of the band anchor, facing the anchor point.

### Execution
1. **Grip the Band**: Grasp the band with both hands, maintaining an overhand grip and your arms extended above you.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body.
3. **Pull Down**: While keeping your elbows close to your body, pull the band down towards your chest. Focus on engaging your lats and upper back.
4. **Control the Movement**: Slowly return to the starting position by allowing the band to stretch upward, maintaining control throughout the movement.

### Key Points
- **Posture**: Keep your back straight and avoid leaning forward.
- **Elbows**: Keep them tucked closely to your sides during the pull.
- **Breathing**: Exhale as you pull down; inhale as you return.

### Common Mistakes
- Arching the back excessively.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.
- Letting elbows flare out.

Maintain focus on form to maximize effectiveness and prevent injury.

Secure a resistance band at a high point above head level. Kneel on a mat facing the anchor, far enough away to create tension in the band.

### Grip the Band
Grasp the band with both hands using an overhand grip, arms fully extended above you. Engage your core to stabilize your torso.

### Pull Down to Your Chest
Keep your elbows close to your body and pull the band down toward your upper chest, focusing on engaging your lats and upper back.

### Control the Return
Slowly allow the band to rise back to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping your back straight throughout.
