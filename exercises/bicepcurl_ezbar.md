## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Start with an EZ bar. Ensure it’s at an appropriate weight for your strength level.
2. **Grip**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grip the EZ bar using the angled sections, palms facing up (supinated grip).

## Positioning
1. **Posture**: Stand upright, shoulders back, and feet flat on the ground.
2. **Elbows**: Keep your elbows close to your body and slightly forward.

## Execution
1. **Curl Movement**: Inhale as you prepare. Exhale as you curl the bar upward by flexing your elbows. Keep your upper arms stationary.
2. **Peak Contraction**: Raise the bar until your forearms are vertical or just below shoulder level. Squeeze the biceps at the top.
3. **Lowering**: Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position while inhaling. Ensure control and avoid letting the weight drop.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid swinging or using momentum; focus on controlled movements.
- Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms.
