## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Start with an EZ bar. Ensure it's at an appropriate weight for your strength level.
2. **Grip**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grip the EZ bar using the angled sections, palms facing up (supinated grip).

## Positioning
1. **Posture**: Stand upright, shoulders back, and feet flat on the ground.
2. **Elbows**: Keep your elbows close to your body and slightly forward.

## Execution
1. **Curl Movement**: Inhale as you prepare. Exhale as you curl the bar upward by flexing your elbows. Keep your upper arms stationary.
2. **Peak Contraction**: Raise the bar until your forearms are vertical or just below shoulder level. Squeeze the biceps at the top.
3. **Lowering**: Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position while inhaling. Ensure control and avoid letting the weight drop.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid swinging or using momentum; focus on controlled movements.
- Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms.

### Grip the EZ Bar
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and grip the EZ bar on the angled sections with palms facing up. The angled grip reduces wrist strain compared to a straight bar.

### Establish Your Posture
Stand upright with shoulders back and elbows close to your body and slightly forward. Maintain a neutral spine throughout.

### Curl Upward
Exhale as you curl the bar upward by flexing your elbows, keeping your upper arms stationary. Raise until your forearms are vertical or just below shoulder level and squeeze the biceps at the top.

### Lower with Control
Inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. Maintain control throughout the descent without letting the weight drop.
