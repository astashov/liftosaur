## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and a weight bench or step.
2. **Starting Position**: Stand upright with the barbell across your upper back, hands gripping the bar.

## Steps
1. **Foot Placement**: Step back with one foot, placing it on the bench or step behind you. Ensure your front foot is flat on the ground.
2. **Stance**: Keep your front leg straight and your back leg bent. Your feet should be about hip-width apart to maintain balance.
3. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Inhale as you lower your body. 
   - Bend your front knee and lower down until your thigh is parallel to the ground.
   - Your back knee should move down toward the floor.
   - Keep your torso upright and engage your core. 
4. **Bottom Position**: Ensure your front knee stays aligned with your toes and does not go past them.
5. **Rising Phase**:
   - Exhale and push through your front heel to rise back to the starting position.
   - Straighten your front leg and return to the starting stance.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Focus on a controlled tempo, especially while lowering.
- Keep your gaze forward to help with balance.

## Common Mistakes
- Leaning too far forward or arching the back excessively.
- Letting the front knee collapse inward.
- Not using a full range of motion.

Ensure you practice the movement with lighter weights initially to master the form before increasing the load.

### Set Up the Barbell
Position a barbell across your upper back and stand upright. Step one foot back and place it on a bench or elevated step behind you, with the front foot flat on the ground.

### Establish Your Stance
Your feet should be hip-width apart for balance. Keep your torso upright and core engaged before beginning the descent.

### Lower into the Squat
Inhale and bend your front knee, lowering your body until your front thigh is parallel to the ground. The back knee should travel toward the floor. Keep the front knee aligned with your toes and avoid excessive forward lean.

### Press Through the Front Heel
Exhale and drive through the front heel to return to the starting position. Straighten the front leg fully at the top. Complete all reps before switching legs.
