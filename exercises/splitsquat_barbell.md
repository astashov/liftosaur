## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and a weight bench or step.
2. **Starting Position**: Stand upright with the barbell across your upper back, hands gripping the bar.

## Steps
1. **Foot Placement**: Step back with one foot, placing it on the bench or step behind you. Ensure your front foot is flat on the ground.
2. **Stance**: Keep your front leg straight and your back leg bent. Your feet should be about hip-width apart to maintain balance.
3. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Inhale as you lower your body. 
   - Bend your front knee and lower down until your thigh is parallel to the ground.
   - Your back knee should move down toward the floor.
   - Keep your torso upright and engage your core. 
4. **Bottom Position**: Ensure your front knee stays aligned with your toes and does not go past them.
5. **Rising Phase**:
   - Exhale and push through your front heel to rise back to the starting position.
   - Straighten your front leg and return to the starting stance.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Focus on a controlled tempo, especially while lowering.
- Keep your gaze forward to help with balance.

## Common Mistakes
- Leaning too far forward or arching the back excessively.
- Letting the front knee collapse inward.
- Not using a full range of motion.

Ensure you practice the movement with lighter weights initially to master the form before increasing the load.
