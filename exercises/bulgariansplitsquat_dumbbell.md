## Setup
1. **Equipment Needed**: Two dumbbells and a bench or stable surface.
2. **Positioning**: Stand a few feet in front of the bench. Place one foot on the bench behind you.

## Execution
1. **Foot Placement**: Ensure your back foot is secured on the bench with the top of your foot resting on it.
2. **Stance**: Keep your front foot flat on the ground, about 2-3 feet in front of you.
3. **Brace Core**: Engage your core to stabilize your torso throughout the movement.

## Movement
1. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Inhale as you lower your body by bending your front knee.
   - Keep your front knee aligned with your ankle; don't let it extend past your toes.
   - Your back knee should be heading towards the ground.

2. **Depth**: Lower until your front thigh is parallel to the ground, or slightly below, while keeping your back knee off the floor.

3. **Rising Phase**:
   - Exhale as you push through your front heel to rise back to the starting position.
   - Maintain balance and control throughout the movement.

## Tips
- **Posture**: Keep your chest lifted and your back straight.
- **Weight Distribution**: Keep your weight centered in your front foot.
- **Breathing**: Remember to breathe: inhale while lowering, exhale while rising.
- **Repetitions**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Common Mistakes
- Letting the front knee cave inward.
- Leaning too far forward; keep a straight back.
- Using too much weight, compromising form.
