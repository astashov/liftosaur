### Setup:
1. **Bench Position**: Set an adjustable bench to a 30-45 degree incline.
2. **Dumbbells**: Grab a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
3. **Starting Position**: Sit on the bench, resting the dumbbells on your thighs. Lean back onto the bench.

#### Execution:
1. **Starting Position**: Raise the dumbbells above your chest with a slight bend in your elbows. Arms should be extended but not locked.
2. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower the dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc. Keep a soft bend in your elbows throughout the movement.
3. **End Position**: Lower until you feel a stretch in your chest, usually until your elbows are at or slightly below shoulder level.
4. **Raising Phase**: Contract your chest and bring the dumbbells back together in the same arc to the starting position while maintaining control.

#### Key Points:
- **Control Movement**: Perform both lowering and raising phases slowly to maintain tension on the chest.
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering, exhale while raising.
- **Maintain Posture**: Keep your shoulder blades retracted and feet flat on the ground for stability.
- **Avoid Overstretching**: Don't let your elbows drop too low to prevent shoulder strain.

#### Common Mistakes:
- **Using Too Much Weight**: Choose a weight that allows you to maintain proper form.
- **Excessive Elbow Movement**: Keep elbows slightly bent without flaring them out wildly.
- **Arching Back**: Maintain a neutral spine to avoid unnecessary strain on the lower back.

This guide ensures you perform the Dumbbell Incline Chest Fly safely and effectively for optimal chest development.

### Set Up
Set the bench to a 30-45 degree incline. Sit and use your thighs to kick the dumbbells up as you lie back, holding them above your chest with palms facing each other and a slight elbow bend.

### Open the Arc
Inhale and lower the dumbbells outward in a wide arc. Keep a soft bend in your elbows and stop when you feel a stretch in your chest, with elbows at or slightly below shoulder level.

### Contract and Return
Exhale and use your chest muscles to bring the dumbbells back together in the same arc to the starting position. Squeeze at the top.

### Maintain Control
Perform both phases slowly to keep constant tension on the chest. Avoid letting elbows drop excessively to protect the shoulders.
