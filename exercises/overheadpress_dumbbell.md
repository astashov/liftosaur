### Starting Position
1. **Stand with Feet Shoulder-Width Apart**: Keep a slight bend in your knees for stability.
2. **Hold Dumbbells**: Raise dumbbells to shoulder height, palms facing forward or towards each other.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to support your spine.
2. **Press Up**: Push the dumbbells overhead in a straight line until your arms are fully extended.
3. **Wrist Position**: Keep wrists neutral, aligned with forearms.
4. **Do Not Lock Elbows**: Stop just before locking out your elbows at the top.
5. **Lower Slowly**: Bring the dumbbells back to the starting position at shoulder height.

### Tips
- **Maintain a Straight Back**: Avoid excessive arching of the lower back.
- **Control the Movement**: Focus on smooth and steady movement both up and down.
- **Breathe**: Exhale when pressing up, inhale when lowering.

### Common Mistakes
- **Tilting the Head Back**: Keep your head neutral, aligning it with your spine.
- **Using Momentum**: Avoid swinging the weights; rely on muscle strength.
- **Forget to Engage Core**: This helps protect your lower back during the lift.
