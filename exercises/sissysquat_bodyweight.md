2. **Core Engagement**: Tighten your core for stability.

### Execution
1. **Lift Heels**: Rise onto your toes, lifting your heels off the ground.
2. **Knees Forward**: Bend your knees and allow them to move forward over your toes. 
3. **Maintain Posture**: Keep your torso upright and maintain a straight line from your head to your knees.
4. **Lowering Phase**: Descend while keeping your heels lifted and your knees tracking over your toes, ideally lowering your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground or lower.
