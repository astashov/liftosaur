## Starting Position
1. **Grip**: Use an underhand grip (palms facing you) on a pull-up bar, hands shoulder-width apart.
2. **Hang**: Start from a dead hang with arms fully extended and legs crossed behind you, engaging your core.

## Execution
1. **Pull-Up**: Begin the movement by engaging your lats and biceps. Pull your body upward until your chin is above the bar.
2. **Elbows**: Keep your elbows close to your body as you pull up. Avoid flaring them out.
3. **Shoulders**: Drive your shoulders down and back as you lift your body.

## Top Position
- **Chin Above Bar**: Hold your chin above the bar for a brief moment, maintaining tension in your muscles.

## Descent
1. **Controlled Lowering**: Lower yourself slowly and with control until your arms are fully extended again.
2. **Avoid Swinging**: Keep your body straight and avoid using momentum.

## Breathing
- **Inhale** during the lowering phase and **exhale** while pulling up.

## Tips
- Keep your body straight, engage your core, and focus on smooth, controlled movements.
- If you struggle to complete a chin-up, consider using an assisted chin-up machine or resistance bands for support. 

## Common Mistakes
- **Arching the Back**: Maintain a neutral spine.
- **Swinging**: Keep the movement strict and minimize swinging for better muscle engagement.

## Progression
- Aim to increase the number of reps as you build strength. Consider varying grip width to target different muscles.
