### Equipment Needed
- Leverage Machine (Chin-up machine with assisted feature)

### Setup
1. **Adjust the Machine**: Set your body weight assistance level if applicable.
2. **Position Your Hands**: Grip the handles with an underhand (supinated) grip, hands shoulder-width apart.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Sit or kneel on the machine's platform. Keep your arms straight and back neutral.
2. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your body.
3. **Pull Up**: Bend your elbows and pull your chin towards the handles. Focus on using your back and biceps.
4. **Control the Movement**: As you lift, keep your elbows close to your body and avoid swinging. 

### Lowering Phase
1. **Slowly Lower Yourself**: Gradually extend your arms back to the starting position, maintaining tension.
2. **Complete the Rep**: Ensure your arms are fully extended without locking your elbows.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Maintain a Straight Back**: Avoid hunching or leaning too far forward.
- **Breath Control**: Exhale while pulling up and inhale while lowering down.
- **Stay Focused**: Concentrate on the muscles being worked; avoid momentum.

### Safety Considerations
- Ensure the machine is properly set up and that you are comfortable before starting.
- If you're new to chin-ups, consider starting with assistance until your strength improves.
