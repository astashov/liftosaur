### Setup
1. **Equipment Needed**: Cable machine with adjustable pulleys and handles.
2. **Adjust the Bench**: Set an incline bench at a 30- to 45-degree angle.

### Execution
1. **Position Yourself**:
   - Sit on the incline bench with your feet flat on the ground.
   - Grip the handles attached to the low pulley system, one in each hand.
   - Keep your arms slightly bent.

2. **Starting Position**:
   - Lean back against the bench, ensuring your back is flat and your shoulders are retracted.
   - Bring the handles up so that your arms are in line with your chest.

3. **Perform the Fly**:
   - As you inhale, slowly lower your arms outward in a wide arc while maintaining the slight bend in your elbows.
   - Keep your elbows at shoulder level to avoid excessive strain.

4. **Return to Start**:
   - Exhale as you contract your chest muscles to bring the handles back together in front of your chest.
   - Focus on squeezing the chest muscles at the top of the movement.

### Tips
- Maintain a controlled pace throughout the exercise.
- Avoid arching your back or using momentum; keep the movement smooth.
- Adjust cable height and bench angle for comfort and optimal range of motion.

### Common Mistakes
- Letting elbows drop too low.
- Using too much weight, leading to poor form.
- Failing to engage the chest muscles effectively.

Ensure proper alignment and listen to your body to prevent injury.
