## Starting Position
1. Adjust the machine to fit your height. The foot pad should be positioned just above your heels.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the pad and your feet secured under the foot pad.
3. Ensure your knees are at a 90-degree angle and your hips align with the machine's pivot point.

## Execution
1. **Initial Posture**: Maintain a neutral spine. Your shoulders should be back and your chest lifted.
2. **Movement**:
   - Begin by leaning forward at the hips, allowing your torso to lower toward the ground. Keep the movement controlled.
   - Stop when your torso is in line with your legs, avoiding excessive rounding of the lower back.

3. **Return Phase**:
   - Engage your lower back and glutes to lift your torso back to the starting position.
   - Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement without hyperextending your back.

## Tips
- Keep your core tight throughout the movement to protect your spine.
- Avoid jerking or using momentum; the movement should be smooth.
- Focus on using your back muscles rather than your arms or legs to perform the extension.

## Common Mistakes
- Hyperextension of the back: Stop before your back starts to overextend.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.
- Letting the shoulders shrug up toward the ears: keep them relaxed and down.

### Conclusion
Performing the leverage machine back extension with proper form helps strengthen the lower back while minimizing injury risk. Always listen to your body and adjust as needed.
