## Setup
1. **Adjust the Machine**: Position the seat and foot platform to ensure your back is supported and your feet can sit flat on the platform.
2. **Load Weights**: Add weight plates to the bar on the Smith machine as needed.

## Positioning
1. **Feet Placement**: Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the foot platform, ensuring your toes point slightly outward.
2. **Back Position**: Sit back against the pad, keeping your back fully supported.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Unlock the bar by lifting the safety catch.
2. **Lowering the Weight**: Inhale as you bend your knees, lowering the platform toward your chest. 
   - Ensure your knees track in line with your toes.
   - Do not let your knees extend past your toes.
3. **Depth**: Lower until your thighs are at least parallel to the platform (or as far as comfortable without rounding your back).
4. **Pressing Up**: Exhale as you push through your heels to return to the starting position.
   - Extend your legs but do not lock out your knees at the top.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Keep your core engaged to support your lower back.
- Use controlled movements; avoid bouncing at the bottom.

## Safety
- Always ensure the safety catch is in place before beginning your set.
- If unsure about your form, seek guidance from a trainer.
