## Starting Position
1. **Set Up the Barbell**: Place a barbell on the ground behind your heels.
2. **Foot Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your toes slightly pointed out.
3. **Grip the Bar**: Bend at the hips and knees, lowering your body to grab the barbell with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Lift the Bar**: Stand up by extending your hips and knees simultaneously, keeping the bar close to your body.
2. **Position the Bar**: The bar should travel along the back of your legs as you rise. Keep your chest up and back straight throughout the movement.
3. **Full Stand**: Fully extend your body at the top before beginning the descent.

## Descent
1. **Lower the Bar**: Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower the bar, maintaining contact with your legs.
2. **Control the Movement**: Keep the movement controlled, ensuring your knees track over your toes. Do not let them cave inwards.
3. **Go as Low as Comfortable**: Lower down until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground or as far as your flexibility allows.

## Key Points
- Keep your core engaged for stability.
- Avoid rounding your back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Breathe in as you lower and exhale as you lift.
- Ensure your weight is balanced through your feet.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the knees to collapse inward.
- Rounding the back during the lift.
- Using excessive weight leading to poor form.

By following these steps, you'll perform the Barbell Hack Squat effectively and safely.
