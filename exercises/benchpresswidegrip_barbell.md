## Setup
1. **Position yourself**: Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the floor.
2. **Grip**: Use a wide grip on the barbell, hands positioned beyond shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Unrack the bar**: Lift the bar off the rack, holding it directly above your chest with arms fully extended.
2. **Lower the bar**: Inhale and lower the bar slowly to your chest, keeping elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body.
3. **Press the bar**: Exhale as you push the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking your elbows.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulder blades retracted and back flat against the bench.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position.
- Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest; control the movement.

## Safety
- Use a spotter or safety clips to avoid accidents.
- Ensure the bench and equipment are stable before starting.

### Press Back Up
Exhale and push the bar back to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking the elbows. Maintain neutral wrists throughout.
