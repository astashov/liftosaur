---

### Setup
1. **Stand tall**: Hold a dumbbell in one hand (opposite side to leg you will lift).
2. **Feet positioning**: Stand with feet hip-width apart.

### Execution
1. **Shift weight**: Shift your weight onto the standing leg.
2. **Lift the opposite leg**: Hinge at the hips and lift the opposite leg straight back while keeping it parallel to the ground.
3. **Lower the dumbbell**: Keep the dumbbell close to your body, lowering it towards the ground while maintaining a flat back.
4. **Maintain balance**: Ensure your standing knee is slightly bent. Avoid locking the knee.
5. **Return to standing**: Engage your glutes and hamstrings to return to the starting position, bringing the lifted leg back down.

### Key Points
- **Keep your core engaged**: This will help maintain balance.
- **Focus on a point**: Fix your gaze on a point ahead to aid stability.
- **Breath control**: Inhale while lowering and exhale while lifting back up.
- **Alignment**: Ensure your back remains straight and shoulders are relaxed throughout the movement. 

### Common Mistakes
- **Rounding the back**: Maintain a neutral spine.
- **Locking the knee**: Keep a slight bend to prevent injury.
- **Overextending the lifted leg**: Keep the leg aligned with your torso.

### Tips
- Start with light weights to master the form.
- Use a mirror or record yourself to check form and alignment.

### Set Up with the Dumbbell
Stand with feet hip-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in one hand (opposite to the leg you will raise) and let it hang at your side.

### Hinge and Extend
Shift your weight to the standing leg and hinge at the hips, extending the opposite leg straight back. Lower the dumbbell toward the ground while maintaining a flat back and slightly bent standing knee.

### Reach the Bottom Position
Lower until your torso is approximately parallel to the floor with the dumbbell close to your body. Keep your hips square and avoid rotating them during the movement.

### Return to Standing
Engage the glutes and hamstrings to drive back to the starting position, bringing the raised leg down. Inhale while lowering and exhale while rising.
