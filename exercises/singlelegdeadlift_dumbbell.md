### Setup
1. **Stand tall**: Hold a dumbbell in one hand (opposite side to leg you will lift).
2. **Feet positioning**: Stand with feet hip-width apart.

### Execution
1. **Shift weight**: Shift your weight onto the standing leg.
2. **Lift the opposite leg**: Hinge at the hips and lift the opposite leg straight back while keeping it parallel to the ground.
3. **Lower the dumbbell**: Keep the dumbbell close to your body, lowering it towards the ground while maintaining a flat back.
4. **Maintain balance**: Ensure your standing knee is slightly bent. Avoid locking the knee.
5. **Return to standing**: Engage your glutes and hamstrings to return to the starting position, bringing the lifted leg back down.

### Key Points
- **Keep your core engaged**: This will help maintain balance.
- **Focus on a point**: Fix your gaze on a point ahead to aid stability.
- **Breath control**: Inhale while lowering and exhale while lifting back up.
- **Alignment**: Ensure your back remains straight and shoulders are relaxed throughout the movement. 

### Common Mistakes
- **Rounding the back**: Maintain a neutral spine.
- **Locking the knee**: Keep a slight bend to prevent injury.
- **Overextending the lifted leg**: Keep the leg aligned with your torso.

### Tips
- Start with light weights to master the form.
- Use a mirror or record yourself to check form and alignment.
