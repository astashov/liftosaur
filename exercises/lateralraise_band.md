**Equipment Needed:**
- Resistance band

**Setup:**
1. **Anchor the Band:** Stand on the center of the band, feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the ends of the band with each hand at your sides.

**Execution:**
1. **Starting Position:** Keep your arms straight but not locked, palms facing inward.
2. **Raise Arms:** Lift your arms out to the sides, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows. 
3. **Form Check:** Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears, and engage your core.
4. **Lift to Shoulder Height:** Stop when your arms are parallel to the ground.
5. **Lower Arms:** Slowly return to the starting position.

**Tips:**
- Avoid swinging the arms; maintain control throughout the movement.
- Keep your wrists in a neutral position.
- Ensure you breathe normally, exhaling as you lift and inhaling as you lower.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Lifting too high, which can stress the shoulder joint.
- Allowing the body to sway or lean during the lift.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Band Lateral Raise while minimizing the risk of injury.
