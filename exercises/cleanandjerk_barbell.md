3. **Grip**: Use an overhand grip, just outside of your knees.

## Clean
1. **Starting Position**: Bend at the hips and knees, keeping your back straight and chest up.
2. **Lift**: Push through your heels, extending your legs and hips while pulling the barbell up close to your body.
3. **Second Pull**: As the bar passes your knees, explosively extend your hips and shrug your shoulders.
4. **Catch**: Rotate your elbows under the bar while dropping your body into a squat position; catch the bar on your shoulders.

## Jerk

2. **Dip**: Bend your knees slightly, keeping your torso upright.
3. **Drive**: Explosively extend your legs while simultaneously pressing the bar overhead.
4. **Catch**: Lock out your arms, with your head and torso slightly forward, allowing the bar to settle above your head.

## Finish

2. **Lowering**: Carefully lower the barbell back to your shoulders, then to the ground in a controlled manner.

## Tips
