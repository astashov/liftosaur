## Clean
1. **Starting Position**: Bend at the hips and knees, keeping your back straight and chest up.
2. **Lift**: Push through your heels, extending your legs and hips while pulling the barbell up close to your body.
3. **Second Pull**: As the bar passes your knees, explosively extend your hips and shrug your shoulders.
4. **Catch**: Rotate your elbows under the bar while dropping your body into a squat position; catch the bar on your shoulders.

## Jerk
1. **Setup for Jerk**: Stand up from the squat while keeping the bar resting on your shoulders.
2. **Dip**: Bend your knees slightly, keeping your torso upright.
3. **Drive**: Explosively extend your legs while simultaneously pressing the bar overhead.
4. **Catch**: Lock out your arms, with your head and torso slightly forward, allowing the bar to settle above your head.

## Finish
1. **Stabilize**: Stand tall, ensuring your feet are shoulder-width apart.
2. **Lowering**: Carefully lower the barbell back to your shoulders, then to the ground in a controlled manner.

## Tips

- Engage your core for stability.

Follow these steps to perform the barbell clean and jerk safely and effectively.

### Set Up for the Clean
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out. Grip the bar just outside your knees with an overhand grip, hips lower than shoulders, and back straight.

### Execute the Clean
Push through your heels and extend hips and knees. As the bar passes your knees, explosively shrug and pull it up, then drop under and catch it on your shoulders.

### Prepare for the Jerk
Stand from the squat with the bar resting on your front deltoids. Take a short dip by bending your knees slightly while keeping your torso upright.

### Drive and Lock Out Overhead
Explosively extend your legs to drive the bar upward, then press and lock your arms out overhead. Stabilize your stance and carefully lower the bar back to shoulders, then to the floor.
