## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use an EZ bar and a flat bench.
2. **Seating**: Lie on your back on the bench with your head slightly off the end.

## Grip
1. **Hand Position**: Take an overhand grip on the EZ bar with hands shoulder-width apart.
2. **Elbows**: Hold the bar above your chest, with elbows locked but not excessively arched.

## Execution
1. **Lowering**: 
   - Slowly bend your elbows to lower the bar towards your forehead.
   - Keep elbows close to your head and stationary.
2. **Pause**: When the bar is near your forehead, pause briefly.
3. **Raising**: 
   - Extend your arms back to the starting position.
   - Focus on squeezing your triceps at the top.

## Form Tips
- **Alignment**: Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms throughout the movement. 
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the bar and exhale as you raise it.
- **Control**: Maintain controlled movements to avoid injury.

## Common Mistakes
- **Flared Elbows**: Keep elbows tucked to prevent shoulder strain.
- **Using Momentum**: Avoid jerking the weight; focus on muscle engagement.
- **Lifting Too Heavy**: Prioritize form over weight to reduce the risk of injury. 

Follow these guidelines to perform the EZ Bar Skullcrusher effectively and safely!
