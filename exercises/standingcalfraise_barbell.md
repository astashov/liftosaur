### Setup
1. **Equipment:** Use a barbell and a weight plate or a raised surface.
2. **Positioning:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with the barbell resting on your upper back (trapezius area). 

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:** Lift your heels off the ground, standing on the balls of your feet. Ensure your knees are slightly bent.
2. **Movement:** 
   - Rise up onto your toes, pushing through the balls of your feet.
   - Keep your core engaged and maintain balance.
3. **Peak Contraction:** Pause briefly at the top of the movement for maximum contraction of the calf muscles.
4. **Descent:** Slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position, letting them drop below the level of the step or ground if possible, to stretch the calves.

### Tips
- Keep your body straight; avoid leaning forward or backward.
- Focus on controlled movements, both up and down.
- Breathe out as you lift and inhale as you lower.

### Common Mistakes
- Lifting with the knees instead of the calves.
- Jerky movements or excessive bouncing at the bottom.
- Letting the torso lean excessively forward or backward.

### Conclusion
Maintain proper form throughout the exercise to effectively target the calf muscles and reduce the risk of injury.

### Set Up with the Barbell
Stand with a barbell resting on your upper back and feet shoulder-width apart. Use a raised surface or weight plate under the balls of your feet for a greater range of motion if desired.

### Lift onto the Toes
Rise onto the balls of your feet by pushing through them, keeping your core engaged and body straight. Avoid leaning forward or backward during the ascent.

### Pause at the Peak
Hold the top position briefly for maximum contraction of the calf muscles before beginning the descent.

### Lower with Control
Slowly lower your heels back to the starting position, allowing them to drop below the level of the step if possible to fully stretch the calves. Breathe out as you lift and inhale as you lower.
