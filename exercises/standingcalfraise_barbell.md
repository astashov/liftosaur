### Setup
1. **Equipment:** Use a barbell and a weight plate or a raised surface.
2. **Positioning:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with the barbell resting on your upper back (trapezius area). 

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:** Lift your heels off the ground, standing on the balls of your feet. Ensure your knees are slightly bent.
2. **Movement:** 
   - Rise up onto your toes, pushing through the balls of your feet.
   - Keep your core engaged and maintain balance.
3. **Peak Contraction:** Pause briefly at the top of the movement for maximum contraction of the calf muscles.
4. **Descent:** Slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position, letting them drop below the level of the step or ground if possible, to stretch the calves.

### Tips
- Keep your body straight; avoid leaning forward or backward.
- Focus on controlled movements, both up and down.
- Breathe out as you lift and inhale as you lower.

### Common Mistakes
- Lifting with the knees instead of the calves.
- Jerky movements or excessive bouncing at the bottom.
- Letting the torso lean excessively forward or backward.

### Conclusion
Maintain proper form throughout the exercise to effectively target the calf muscles and reduce the risk of injury.
