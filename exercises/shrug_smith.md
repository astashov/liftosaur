---

## Setup
1. **Position the Smith Machine Bar:** Set the bar at about mid-thigh level when standing.
2. **Stand Under the Bar:** Position yourself under the bar so it rests comfortably on your upper traps.
3. **Grip the Bar:** Use an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.

## Execution
1. **Unrack the Bar:** Stand tall, engaging your core to lift the bar off the rack.
2. **Feet Placement:** Position your feet shoulder-width apart for stability.
3. **Shrug Movement:** 
   - Raise your shoulders towards your ears by contracting your trapezius muscles.
   - Avoid bending your elbows; keep arms straight.
4. **Hold at the Top:** Briefly pause at the peak of the shrug for maximum contraction.
5. **Lower the Bar:** Gradually return to the starting position by lowering your shoulders back down.

## Tips
- **Maintain a Neutral Spine:** Keep your back straight to avoid injury.
- **Controlled Motion:** Focus on a slow, controlled movement in both directions.
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you shrug up, and inhale as you lower the bar.

## Common Mistakes
- **Using Too Much Weight:** Prevent momentum use; select a manageable weight.
- **Rolling Shoulders:** Focus on a straight up-and-down shrug rather than a rolling motion.
- **Hyperextending Neck:** Keep your neck neutral to avoid strain. 

Ensure safety by using a spotter if needed.

### Position Under the Bar
Set the Smith machine bar to mid-thigh height. Stand under the bar and grip it with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, then unrack it by standing tall.

### Set Your Stance
Step feet shoulder-width apart for stability. Engage your core and keep a neutral spine before beginning the movement.

### Perform the Shrug
Raise your shoulders straight up toward your ears by contracting the trapezius. Keep your arms straight and avoid bending the elbows or rolling the shoulders.

### Hold and Descend
Pause briefly at the peak contraction, then gradually lower your shoulders back to the starting position. Exhale on the way up and inhale on the way down.
