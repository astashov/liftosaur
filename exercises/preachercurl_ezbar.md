### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use an EZ bar and a preacher curl bench.
2. **Positioning**: Sit on the preacher bench with your chest against the pad. Grab the EZ bar with an underhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Arms should be fully extended, hanging over the edge of the bench.
2. **Curl Movement**:
   - Keep your elbows stationary against the pad.
   - Curl the barbell towards your shoulders by flexing your elbows.
   - Squeeze at the top of the movement for a brief moment.
3. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, ensuring full extension of the arms.
   - Maintain control throughout the descent.

### Tips
- Keep your wrists straight; avoid bending them.
- Focus on using your biceps, not your back or shoulders.
- Breathe out during the curl and inhale while lowering the bar. 

### Common Mistakes
- Using too much weight and compromising form.
- Allowing elbows to drift off the pad.
- Swinging the body to initiate the curl.
