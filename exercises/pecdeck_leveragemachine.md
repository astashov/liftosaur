## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Sit on the machine and adjust the seat height so that the handles align with your chest level.
2. **Choose the Weight**: Select an appropriate weight for your fitness level.

## Starting Position
1. **Posture**: Sit back against the padded support with your back flat and shoulders relaxed.
2. **Grip**: Grasp the handles with your palms facing forward or inwards, depending on the machine design. Keep your elbows slightly bent.

## Execution
