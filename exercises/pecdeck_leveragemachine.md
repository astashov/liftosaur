## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Sit on the machine and adjust the seat height so that the handles align with your chest level.
2. **Choose the Weight**: Select an appropriate weight for your fitness level.

## Starting Position
1. **Posture**: Sit back against the padded support with your back flat and shoulders relaxed.
2. **Grip**: Grasp the handles with your palms facing forward or inwards, depending on the machine design. Keep your elbows slightly bent.

## Execution
1. **Initiate Movement**: Push the handles together in a controlled manner, focusing on squeezing your chest muscles.
2. **Range of Motion**: Continue until your hands are close together but avoid locking your elbows at the end of the movement.
3. **Return**: Gradually release the handles back to the starting position, ensuring you maintain control throughout.

## Key Points
- Keep your feet flat on the ground and avoid arching your back.
- Engage your core throughout the exercise to maintain stability.
- Breathe out during the pressing phase and inhale as you return to the starting position.
- Maintain a smooth, controlled motion without using momentum. 

## Common Mistakes
- Overextending or locking the elbows.
- Allowing the shoulders to rise or shrug.
- Not using full range of motion.

Following these guidelines will help you effectively perform the Leverage Machine Pec Deck with proper form and reduce the risk of injury.
