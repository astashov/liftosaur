2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
3. Let your arms hang down at your sides.

## Execution
1. **Curl**: Keep your elbows close to your torso. 
2. **Movement**: Curl the weights up towards your shoulders while keeping the palms facing each other throughout the movement.

## Common Mistakes
