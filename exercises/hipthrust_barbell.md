**Setup:**
1. **Equipment:** Use a barbell, bench, and a mat or pad.
2. **Positioning:** Sit on the ground with your upper back against a bench. Roll the barbell over your hips and use a mat or pad for comfort.

**Feet Placement:**
- Place your feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Your heels should be about a foot away from the bench.

**Execution:**
1. **Starting Position:** Engage your core. Your spine should remain neutral.
2. **Lift:** Drive through your heels, pressing your hips upward. Extend fully at the top, squeezing your glutes.
3. **Top Position:** Your body should form a straight line from shoulders to knees at the peak of the lift.
4. **Lowering:** Slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

**Breathing:**
- Inhale as you lower your hips and exhale as you thrust upward.

**Key Points:**
- Keep your chin tucked to maintain a neutral spine.
- Avoid overarching your lower back at the top of the movement.
- Ensure your knees don't cave inward; they should stay in line with your toes.

Following these steps will help you perform the Barbell Hip Thrust with proper form, targeting the glutes effectively.
