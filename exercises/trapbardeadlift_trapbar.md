## Equipment Needed
- Trap bar

## Setup
1. **Positioning**: Stand in the center of the trap bar with your feet hip-width apart.
2. **Grip**: Bend at your hips and knees to grab the neutral handles of the trap bar.
3. **Foot Placement**: Ensure your shins are close to the bar without touching.

## Form
1. **Back Position**: Keep your spine neutral. Avoid rounding your back; maintain a straight line from head to tailbone.
2. **Core Engagement**: Brace your core by tightening your abdominal muscles.
3. **Shoulders**: Pull your shoulders back and down; keep them retracted throughout the lift.
4. **Knees**: Ensure your knees track over your toes while maintaining a stable stance.

## Execution
1. **Initiate the Lift**: Push through your heels and extend your hips and knees simultaneously.
2. **Lift**: Bring your torso up while keeping the trap bar close to your body.
3. **End Position**: Stand tall with your chest up and shoulders back at the top of the lift.
4. **Lowering**: Reverse the movement by hinging at the hips, guiding the bar down until you return to the starting position, maintaining the same form.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Rounding the back during the lift.
- Allowing the knees to cave inward.
- Lifting too much weight without proper form.

Remember to focus on your breathing throughout the lift, exhaling during the upward phase and inhaling as you lower the weight.
