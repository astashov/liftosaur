**Equipment Needed:** Resistance band

### Steps:

1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Hold the resistance band with both hands, palms facing down, about shoulder-width apart.

2. **Foot Placement:**
   - Step onto the middle of the band with both feet, ensuring there is tension in the band.

3. **Posture:**
   - Keep your back straight, chest up, and core engaged.
   - Allow your arms to hang naturally in front of you.

4. **Execution:**
   - Raise the band in front of you with straight arms.
   - Lift until your arms are parallel to the ground, keeping elbows slightly bent.

5. **Control:**
   - Avoid using momentum; raise and lower the band in a controlled manner.
   - Pause briefly at the top of the movement.

6. **Return:**
   - Slowly lower the band back to the starting position while maintaining control.

7. **Breathing:**
   - Exhale as you lift the band; inhale as you lower it.

#### Tips:
- Focus on keeping your shoulders down and relaxed throughout the movement.
- Adjust the resistance by using a thicker band or changing the grip on the band for more or less tension.

#### Common Mistakes:
- Raising the band too high (overhead) leading to shoulder strain.
- Arching the back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Using momentum rather than engaging the shoulders effectively.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure a safe and effective Band Front Raise.
