**Equipment Needed:** Resistance band

### Steps:

1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Hold the resistance band with both hands, palms facing down, about shoulder-width apart.

2. **Foot Placement:**
   - Step onto the middle of the band with both feet, ensuring there is tension in the band.

3. **Posture:**
   - Keep your back straight, chest up, and core engaged.
   - Allow your arms to hang naturally in front of you.

4. **Execution:**
   - Raise the band in front of you with straight arms.
   - Lift until your arms are parallel to the ground, keeping elbows slightly bent.

5. **Control:**
   - Avoid using momentum; raise and lower the band in a controlled manner.
   - Pause briefly at the top of the movement.

6. **Return:**
   - Slowly lower the band back to the starting position while maintaining control.

7. **Breathing:**
   - Exhale as you lift the band; inhale as you lower it.

#### Tips:
- Focus on keeping your shoulders down and relaxed throughout the movement.
- Adjust the resistance by using a thicker band or changing the grip on the band for more or less tension.

#### Common Mistakes:
- Raising the band too high (overhead) leading to shoulder strain.
- Arching the back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Using momentum rather than engaging the shoulders effectively.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure a safe and effective Band Front Raise.

### Set Up Your Stance
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart on the middle of the resistance band. Hold the band with both hands, palms facing down, about shoulder-width apart.

### Engage Your Core
Keep your back straight, chest up, and core tight. Allow your arms to hang naturally in front of you with tension already in the band.

### Raise to Shoulder Height
Lift the band straight in front of you with arms slightly bent until they are parallel to the ground. Pause briefly at the top and avoid using momentum.

### Lower with Control
Slowly lower the band back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Exhale as you raise and inhale as you lower, keeping your shoulders relaxed throughout.
