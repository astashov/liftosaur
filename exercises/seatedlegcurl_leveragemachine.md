1. **Setup**  
   - Adjust the backrest so your knees are aligned with the machine's pivot point.
   - Sit down and place your legs on the padded lever, positioning your ankles just above your heels.

2. **Foot Placement**  
   - Ensure your feet are flexed with your toes pointed slightly upward.
   - Your knees should be at a 90-degree angle when starting.

3. **Grip**  
   - Hold onto the side handles of the machine for stability.

4. **Curl Movement**  
   - Exhale and curl your legs down by flexing your knees, bringing your heels towards your glutes.
   - Keep your upper body pressed against the backrest throughout the movement.

5. **Peak Contraction**  
   - At the bottom of the curl, pause briefly to maximize muscle contraction.

6. **Returning**  
   - Inhale and lower your legs back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
   - Avoid using momentum; focus on a slow return.

7. **Repetition**  
   - Repeat for desired repetitions, maintaining proper form throughout.

### Key Points
- Maintain a neutral spine.
- Avoid locking your knees at the start/end of the movement.
- Adjust the machine settings as needed for comfort and proper alignment.
