## Starting Position
1. **Setup**: Place a barbell across your upper back, resting on your trapezius muscles. Grip the barbell with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. **Stand Tall**: Keep your feet hip-width apart and brace your core. Stand up straight with shoulders back.

## Execution
1. **Step Forward**: Take a large step forward with one leg, allowing the back knee to lower toward the ground.
2. **Knee Position**: Ensure that the front knee is aligned over the ankle and does not extend past the toes.
3. **Lowering**: Lower your body until both knees are bent at approximately 90 degrees.
4. **Push Back**: Press through the front heel to return to the starting position, bringing the back foot forward to meet the front foot.
5. **Repeat**: Alternate legs for the desired number of lunges.

## Key Points
- Maintain an upright torso throughout the movement.
- Engage your core to stabilize your spine.
- Keep your back leg straight as you descend.
- Breathe in while stepping down, and out while pushing back up.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the front knee to collapse inward.
- Leaning forward excessively with the torso.
- Not controlling the descent.

By following these steps, you can perform the barbell lunge safely and effectively.
