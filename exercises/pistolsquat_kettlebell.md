### Setup
1. **Kettlebell Grip**: Hold a kettlebell by the horns with both hands, keeping it close to your chest or at arm's length for balance.
2. **Stance**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointed slightly outward.

### Execution
1. **One-Leg Lift**: Shift your weight to one leg and lift the opposite leg off the ground, extending it forward.
2. **Squat Down**: Lower your body by bending the standing knee while keeping the lifted leg extended in front of you.
3. **Depth**: Aim to squat down until your hip is below your knee on the standing leg. Maintain your balance and control.
4. **Core Engagement**: Keep your core tight and ensure your back remains straight throughout the movement.
5. **Return**: Push through your heel to stand back up, returning to the starting position while keeping the lifted leg extended.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Knee Alignment**: Ensure your knee stays in line with your toes; avoid letting it cave inward.
- **Controlled Movement**: Perform the squat slowly to maintain stability and control.
- **Breathe**: Inhale as you lower and exhale as you push back up.

### Common Mistakes
- **Rounding the back**: Keep a neutral spine.
- **Loss of balance**: Focus on a fixed point in front of you.
- **Not engaging the core**: Always keep the core tight for stability.

### Progression
Start with a lighter kettlebell or no weight at all until you master the form, then gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable.
