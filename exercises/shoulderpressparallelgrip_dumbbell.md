### Starting Position
1. **Stance**: Stand or sit on a bench with back support. Feet should be shoulder-width apart.
2. **Dumbbells**: Hold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other (parallel grip).
3. **Positioning**: Raise the dumbbells to shoulder height, elbows bent at about 90 degrees, and keep wrists straight.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your spine.
2. **Press**: Extend your arms upward, pushing the dumbbells straight above your head until arms are fully extended. 
3. **Wrist Alignment**: Ensure wrists remain directly above or slightly behind elbows throughout the movement.
4. **Control Descent**: Lower the dumbbells back down to shoulder height in a controlled manner, maintaining elbow positioning.

### Breathing
- Inhale while lowering the dumbbells.
- Exhale while pressing them up.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Avoid Overarching Back**: Maintain a neutral spine; avoid leaning back excessively.
- **Elbow Movement**: Keep elbows aligned with wrists; do not let them flare out too much.
- **Head Position**: Keep your head neutral, looking forward rather than up.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Using Momentum**: Avoid swinging the dumbbells; rely on muscle strength.
- **Incorrect Grip**: Ensure grip is firm and aligned properly with forearms.
- **Limited Range of Motion**: Fully extend arms but not lock out elbows at the top.

### Safety Precautions
- Use appropriate weights to avoid strain.
- If standing, consider a stable surface if you feel unstable.
- Stop if you experience any pain outside of normal muscle fatigue.
