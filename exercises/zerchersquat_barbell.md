## Setup
1. **Bar Position**: Place the barbell on a squat rack at elbow height.
2. **Hand Placement**: Stand close to the bar, with feet shoulder-width apart. Grip the bar with both hands, elbows bent, positioning it in the crooks of your arms.

## Execution
1. **Lift the Bar**: Step back, keeping the bar securely in your arms, and position your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Stance**: Point your toes slightly outward for stability.
3. **Squat Down**:
   - Initiate the squat by pushing your hips back while bending your knees.
   - Keep your chest up, back straight, and core engaged.
   - Go down until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground or lower if mobility allows.
4. **Return to Start**:
   - Press through your heels.
   - Straighten your legs while maintaining the upright torso.
   - Keep your elbows close to your body throughout the movement.

## Tips
- Ensure that your knees track over your toes.
- Maintain a neutral spine to avoid back strain.
- Focus on breathing: inhale when lowering, exhale when pushing up.

## Common Mistakes  
- Allowing the elbows to drift forward, which can place strain on the arms.
- Leaning too far forward or rounding the back during the squat.  
- Not using a proper stance, leading to instability.

## Conclusion
Performing the Barbell Zercher Squat with proper form maximizes effectiveness while minimizing the risk of injury. Ensure you maintain control throughout the movement for optimal results.
