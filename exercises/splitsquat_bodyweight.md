### Starting Position:
1. Stand upright with your feet hip-width apart.
2. Step one foot back about 2-3 feet, keeping both feet pointing forward.

### Tips for Proper Form:

- Leaning too far forward.

### Take the Split Stance
Stand upright with feet hip-width apart, then step one foot back about 2-3 feet. Keep both feet pointing forward and your torso upright.

### Lower the Body
Bend both knees simultaneously, lowering until your back knee nearly touches the floor. Keep your front knee aligned over your ankle and your core engaged throughout.

### Maintain an Upright Torso
Avoid leaning forward during the descent. Keep your hips square and level to prevent any rotation or shifting.

### Drive Back Up
Press through the front heel to return to the starting position. Exhale as you rise. Complete all reps on one side, then switch legs.
