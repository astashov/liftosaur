### Starting Position:
1. Stand upright with your feet hip-width apart.
2. Step one foot back about 2-3 feet, keeping both feet pointing forward.

### Execution:
1. Lower your body by bending both knees.
2. Keep your front knee aligned over your ankle, not extending past your toes.
3. Lower until your back knee nearly touches the ground.
4. Keep your torso upright and engage your core throughout the movement.
5. Push through the front heel to return to the starting position.

### Tips for Proper Form:
- Ensure your hips remain square and level.
- Keep your front foot flat on the ground.
- Maintain a straight back and avoid leaning forward.
- Breathe in as you lower and exhale as you push back up.

### Common Mistakes:
- Letting the front knee collapse inward.
- Leaning too far forward.
- Losing balance or wobbling during the movement.

### Variations:
- Add a pause at the bottom for increased difficulty.
- Try a dynamic version by alternating legs. 

### Reminder:
Always perform the exercise in a controlled manner to maximize effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury.
