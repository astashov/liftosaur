### Starting Position
1. Lie on your back on a flat surface with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Bend one knee and place that foot flat on the floor.
3. Extend the opposite leg straight out, keeping it in line with your body.

### Execution
1. Engage your core and press your heel into the ground of the bent leg.
2. Lift your hips towards the ceiling by pushing through the standing heel.
3. Keep your extended leg in line with your torso and avoid letting it drop or bend.
4. Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.
5. Hold the bridge position for a moment, focusing on engaging your glutes and hamstrings.

### Return
1. Lower your hips back to the initial starting position slowly and with control.
2. Switch legs and repeat the exercise.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your shoulders and head flat on the ground.
- Avoid arching your lower back; keep it neutral.
- Ensure your knees remain aligned with your feet to prevent strain.
- Breathe steadily throughout the movement.
