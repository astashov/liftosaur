---

### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band, preferably a light to medium tension band.
2. **Anchor Point**: Secure the band to a stable overhead point. This could be a door anchor or other sturdy fixture.

### Positioning
1. **Starting Position**: Stand with your back to the anchor point, holding the band with both hands. Your arms should be bent at a 90-degree angle, elbows close to your head.
2. **Grip**: Use a neutral grip (palms facing each other) or an overhand grip (palms facing down).

### Execution
1. **Extension**: Extend your arms upward, pushing against the band. Focus on straightening your elbows while keeping your upper arms stationary.
2. **Alignment**: Ensure your elbows remain close to your head throughout the movement.
3. **Control**: Slowly return to the starting position to complete one repetition. Maintain tension in the band as you lower the arms.

### Tips
- **Core Engagement**: Keep your core engaged for stability.
- **Breathing**: Exhale during the extension phase and inhale while returning to the starting position.
- **Avoid Arching**: Keep your back straight and avoid arching during the exercise.

### Common Mistakes
- Allowing elbows to flare out.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.
- Overextending beyond the point of tension in the band.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Band Triceps Extension while minimizing the risk of injury.
