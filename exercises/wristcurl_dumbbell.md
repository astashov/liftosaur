## Starting Position
- Sit on a bench or chair.
- Hold a dumbbell in one hand with your palm facing up.
- Rest your forearm on your thigh or a flat surface, allowing your wrist to hang off the edge.

## Execution
1. **Grip the Dumbbell**: Ensure a firm grip on the dumbbell with your palm facing upwards.
2. **Curl Up**: Slowly curl the dumbbell upwards by flexing your wrist.
3. **Squeeze at Top**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your wrist for a moment.
4. **Lower Down**: Gradually lower the dumbbell back to the starting position, maintaining control.

## Tips
- Keep your forearm stationary; only the wrist should be moving.
- Perform the exercise in a slow and controlled manner.
- Focus on the contraction of the wrist flexors during the movement.
- Alternate arms after completing the set with one side.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting with the arms instead of the wrists.
- Using too much weight, leading to poor form.
- Bouncing the dumbbell instead of using a smooth motion.
