## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Sit on the machine and adjust the seat so that your back is comfortably against the pad.
2. **Position Your Feet**: Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, ensuring your heels are flat and toes slightly pointed out.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Begin with your knees at a 90-degree angle, maintaining a neutral back position against the pad.
2. **Press Movement**: Engage your core and push the platform away by extending your legs. Focus on using your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.
3. **Range of Motion**: Extend until your legs are nearly straight but do not lock your knees.
4. **Return Movement**: Slowly lower the platform back towards your body, keeping your control and maintaining the 90-degree angle at the bottom position.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the platform and exhale as you press it away.
- **Avoid Excess Weight**: Focus on form over weight; do not compromise your technique.
- **Knee Alignment**: Ensure your knees stay aligned with your toes throughout the movement.

## Safety
- **Start Light**: Begin with a lighter load to master the form before adding more weight.
- **Watch Your Back**: Keep your back pressed against the pad to prevent strain. 

By following these steps, you can effectively and safely perform the leverage machine leg press.
