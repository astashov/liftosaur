---

### Starting Position
1. **Set Up:** Attach an ankle strap to the low pulley of a cable machine.
2. **Adjust Height:** Ensure the strap is at ankle height.
3. **Position Yourself:** Stand next to the machine, facing away, with the ankle strap on the outside leg.

### Execution
1. **Stabilize:** Hold onto the machine or a stable surface for support.
2. **Lift Leg:** Keeping your standing leg slightly bent, lift the strapped leg away from your body in a controlled manner.
3. **Range of Motion:** Raise the leg until it's parallel to the ground, ensuring a straight line from your hip to your ankle.
4. **Control Descent:** Lower the leg back to the starting position without letting it touch the ground.

### Tips
- **Body Alignment:** Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning to the side.
- **Core Engagement:** Engage your core for stability throughout the movement.
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you lift the leg, inhale as you lower it.

### Common Mistakes
- **Overarching the Back:** Maintain a neutral spine.
- **Using Momentum:** Avoid fast movements; focus on control.

### Variations
- Adjust the weight for difficulty.
- Perform the exercise seated or lying down for a different angle of resistance.

### Set Up
Attach an ankle strap to the low cable pulley. Stand next to the machine with the strap secured on your outside ankle and hold onto the machine for balance.

### Stabilize Your Stance
Slightly bend your standing knee and engage your core. Keep your torso upright throughout the movement.

### Lift Laterally
Sweep the strapped leg away from your body in a controlled arc until it is parallel to the ground. Focus on the hip abductor muscles.

### Lower with Control
Bring the leg back to the starting position without letting it touch the floor to maintain tension. Complete all reps before switching sides.
