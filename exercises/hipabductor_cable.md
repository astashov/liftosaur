### Starting Position
1. **Set Up:** Attach an ankle strap to the low pulley of a cable machine.
2. **Adjust Height:** Ensure the strap is at ankle height.
3. **Position Yourself:** Stand next to the machine, facing away, with the ankle strap on the outside leg.

### Execution
1. **Stabilize:** Hold onto the machine or a stable surface for support.
2. **Lift Leg:** Keeping your standing leg slightly bent, lift the strapped leg away from your body in a controlled manner.
3. **Range of Motion:** Raise the leg until it's parallel to the ground, ensuring a straight line from your hip to your ankle.
4. **Control Descent:** Lower the leg back to the starting position without letting it touch the ground.

### Tips
- **Body Alignment:** Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning to the side.
- **Core Engagement:** Engage your core for stability throughout the movement.
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you lift the leg, inhale as you lower it.

### Common Mistakes
- **Overarching the Back:** Maintain a neutral spine.
- **Using Momentum:** Avoid fast movements; focus on control.

### Variations
- Adjust the weight for difficulty.
- Perform the exercise seated or lying down for a different angle of resistance.
