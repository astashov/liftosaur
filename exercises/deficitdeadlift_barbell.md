### Setup

2. **Barbell Position:** Place the barbell over your mid-foot.
3. **Foot Placement:** Feet hip-width apart with toes slightly outward.

#### Grip
1. **Hand Position:** Use a double overhand or mixed grip, just outside your knees.
2. **Wrist Position:** Keep wrists straight and in line with your forearms.

#### Initiate Lift
1. **Hips and Chest:** Drop your hips and lower your chest while maintaining a straight back.
2. **Engage Core:** Brace your core to stabilize your spine.

#### Lift
1. **Drive Through Heels:** Push through your heels, engaging your legs as you lift.
2. **Hips and Shoulders:** Extend hips and shoulders simultaneously to keep the bar close to your body.

#### Lockout
1. **Stand Tall:** Fully extend your hips and knees at the top.
2. **Shoulders Back:** Pull your shoulders back without hyperextending your lower back.

#### Lowering the Bar
1. **Hip Hinge:** Push your hips back while maintaining a straight back to lower the bar.
2. **Keep Bar Close:** Ensure the bar stays close to your body throughout the descent.

### Tips
- **Neutral Spine:** Maintain a neutral spine to avoid injury.
- **Breath Control:** Inhale before lowering the bar and exhale as you lift.
- **Footwear:** Use flat-soled shoes for stability. 

### Common Mistakes
- **Rounding the Back:** Avoid hunching your back during lift.
- **Raising Hips Too Soon:** Ensure hips and chest lift together.
- **Lifting Too Quickly:** Control the movement throughout the range. 

Following these steps will help you perform the Barbell Deficit Deadlift with proper form and effectiveness.
