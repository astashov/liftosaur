## Starting Position
- Hang from a pull-up bar with an overhand grip, arms fully extended.
- Keep your body straight and engage your core.

## Execution
1. **Engage**: Tighten your core and initiate the movement by tilting your pelvis backward.
2. **Leg Lift**: Lift your legs together towards the bar, maintaining a slight bend in your knees if necessary.
3. **Toes to Bar**: As your legs rise, flex at the hips and bring your toes up towards the bar.
4. **Control Descent**: Lower your legs back to the starting position with control, avoiding swinging.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your shoulders active; avoid excessive rounding or sagging.
- Focus on a smooth, fluid motion rather than rushing through the movement.
- Breathe out as you lift your legs and inhale as you lower them.

## Common Mistakes
- Swinging or using momentum instead of controlled movement.
- Letting the shoulders disengage or dropping the legs without control.

## Progressions
- Start with knee raises or hanging leg raises if unable to perform full toes to bar. 

By following these steps and tips, you can perform bodyweight toes to bar effectively and safely.
