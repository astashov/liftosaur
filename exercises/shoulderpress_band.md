## Setup
1. **Choose Resistance Band**: Select an appropriate resistance band based on your fitness level.
2. **Position the Band**: Stand on the center of the band, feet shoulder-width apart. Both ends of the band should be in your hands.

## Starting Position
1. **Grip**: Hold the band with palms facing forward, elbows bent at about 90 degrees.
2. **Elbows**: Keep elbows in line with your shoulders, not flaring out.

## Execution
1. **Press Up**: Extend your arms upward, straightening at the elbows while maintaining a neutral wrist position.
2. **Full Extension**: Reach your arms overhead without locking your elbows at the top.
3. **Controlled Descent**: Slowly lower your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control of the band.

## Tips
- **Core Engagement**: Tighten your core for stability throughout the movement.
- **Breathing**: Exhale as you press up, inhale while lowering.

## Common Mistakes
- **Arching Back**: Keep your back straight and avoid excessive arching.
- **Flared Elbows**: Maintain elbows in line with shoulders to protect joints.

### Safety
- Ensure the band is securely anchored to avoid snapping.
- Start with a lighter resistance and increase as you master the form.
