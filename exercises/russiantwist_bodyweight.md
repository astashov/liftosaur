---

## Starting Position
1. Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat.
2. Lean back slightly to engage your core, keeping your back straight.
3. Elevate your feet off the ground for increased intensity, balancing on your sit bones.

## Execution
1. Clasp your hands together in front of your chest.
2. Rotate your torso to the right by engaging your core, keeping your hips stable.
3. Bring your hands beside your hip or touch the floor (if elevated).
4. Return to the center and rotate to the left, maintaining control.
5. Repeat this rotation back and forth.

## Key Points
- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement to protect your lower back.
- Shoulders should remain relaxed and away from your ears.
- Focus on controlled movements rather than speed.
- Keep your feet together during the twist for stability.

## Common Mistakes
- Letting the lower back curve excessively.
- Moving the hips instead of the torso.
- Not engaging the core fully.

## Modifications
- For a beginner, keep your feet on the ground.
- Increase difficulty by holding a weight or pausing at each side.
