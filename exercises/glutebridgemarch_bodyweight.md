### Starting Position:
1. **Lie on your back** on a mat or flat surface.
2. **Bend your knees**, placing your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
3. **Arms rest at your sides** or can be placed on your lower abdomen for added engagement.

### Execution:
1. **Lift your hips** off the ground into a bridge position by pressing your heels into the floor.
2. **Engage your glutes** and core to maintain stability.
3. From the bridge position, **lift your right leg** off the ground, bringing your knee toward your chest without dropping your hips.
4. **Lower the right leg back down** to the starting position while maintaining the bridge.
5. **Repeat with the left leg**, lifting it towards your chest and lowering back down.
6. **Continue alternating legs** in a controlled manner, ensuring your hips remain lifted and stable throughout.

### Tips for Proper Form:
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and pressed into the ground.
- Avoid arching your back; keep a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Focus on squeezing your glutes as you lift and lower each leg.
- Move slowly to maintain balance and engage the correct muscles.

### Common Mistakes:
- Letting the hips sag; ensure they stay elevated.
- Moving too quickly, which reduces the effectiveness.
- Overarching the lower back; maintain a neutral spine.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Bodyweight Glute Bridge March effectively and safely.

### Set Up the Bridge
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Press through your heels to lift your hips into a bridge position and engage your glutes.

### Stabilize Your Hips
Brace your core and squeeze your glutes to keep your hips level and elevated. Your body should form a straight line from shoulders to knees.

### March Each Leg
Lift one knee toward your chest without letting your hips drop, then return it to the ground. Alternate legs in a slow, controlled manner.

### Maintain Position
Keep your shoulders pressed into the ground and avoid arching your lower back throughout the movement.
