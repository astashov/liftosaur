## Setup
1. **Stand Tall**: Begin by standing upright with your feet hip-width apart.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to maintain balance.

## Execution
1. **Shift Weight**: Shift your weight onto one leg, keeping the opposite leg relaxed.
2. **Hinge at Hips**: Begin to lean forward at the hips, pushing your hips back. 
3. **Extend Opposite Leg**: While leaning forward, extend the opposite leg straight back, maintaining hip alignment. Keep your back straight and chest up.
4. **Lower Down**: Go until your torso is parallel to the ground, or as low as your flexibility allows, ensuring the extended leg remains in line with your body.
5. **Return**: Reverse the movement by driving through the standing heel, bringing your torso back to standing position while lowering the extended leg.

## Tips
- **Maintain Balance**: Focus on a fixed point in front of you to enhance stability.
- **Control Movement**: Move slowly and with control to prevent injury.
- **Breath**: Inhale as you lower, exhale as you return to standing.

## Common Mistakes
- **Rounding Back**: Keep your spine straight to avoid back strain.
- **Locking Knee**: Maintain a slight bend in the standing leg to reduce stress on the knee.
- **Overextending Hips**: Ensure your hips remain square and do not rotate as you move. 

Following these steps will help you perform the Bodyweight Single Leg Deadlift with proper form, maximizing effectiveness while minimizing injury risk.

### Stand on One Leg
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart and shift your weight onto one leg. Engage your core and keep a slight bend in the standing knee.

### Hinge at the Hips
Lean forward at the hips, pushing them back while simultaneously extending the free leg straight behind you. Keep your back flat and chest up throughout.

### Lower to Parallel
Descend until your torso is roughly parallel to the ground, or as low as your flexibility allows. Keep the extended leg in line with your body and hips square.

### Drive Back to Standing
Reverse the movement by driving through the standing heel and engaging the glutes and hamstrings to return upright. Exhale as you rise and focus on a fixed point for balance.
