### Starting Position
1. **Stance**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointing outward.
2. **Grip**: Hold a dumbbell with both hands, palms facing each other, letting it hang between your legs.

#### Execution
1. **Hinge**: Bend at your hips and knees while keeping your back flat. Push your hips back to lower the dumbbell between your legs.
2. **Swing**: Drive your hips forward explosively, allowing the dumbbell to swing upward towards shoulder height. Keep your arms extended but relaxed.
3. **Alignment**: At the top of the swing, your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels. Engage your core and squeeze your glutes.
4. **Descent**: Lower the dumbbell back down by hinging at the hips again, maintaining control as it swings back down.

#### Breathing
- **Inhale** as you hinge down.
- **Exhale** forcefully as you drive your hips forward and swing the dumbbell up.

#### Key Points
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout.
- Avoid using your arms to lift the weight; focus on hip thrust.
- Keep your movements smooth and controlled.

#### Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back: Keep a straight back.
- Lifting with arms: Use hip drive, not arm strength.
- Overextending: Don't let the dumbbell go higher than shoulder height.

By following these steps, you can perform the Dumbbell Kettlebell Swing effectively and safely.
