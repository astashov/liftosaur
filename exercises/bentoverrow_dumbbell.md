### Starting Position
1. **Stand with Feet**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Hold Dumbbells**: Grip a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
3. **Bend at Hips**: Hinge at the hips, lowering your torso until it's almost parallel to the ground. Keep a slight bend in your knees.
4. **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight and back straight to maintain a neutral spine.

### Movement
1. **Pull Dumbbells**: Engage your back muscles and pull the dumbbells towards your lower rib cage. Elbows should stay close to your body.
2. **Squeeze**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
3. **Lower Weights**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, controlling the weight throughout.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Head Position**: Keep your head in line with your spine, looking slightly forward.
- **Avoid Round Back**: Do not round your back; maintain a flat back throughout the exercise.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while pulling weights up, inhale while lowering them.
- **Range of Motion**: Ensure a full range of motion; don’t rush the movement.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Using Momentum**: Avoid swinging the weights; focus on muscle contraction.
- **Overextending Neck**: Don’t strain your neck; keep it neutral.
- **Wide Elbows**: Keep elbows close to your body to target the back muscles effectively.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Dumbbell Bent Over Row with proper form and maximize its benefits.
