5. **Drive Through Heel:**
   - Press through your heel to lift your body up, straightening your leg while keeping your chest up and back straight.

6. **Controlled Descent:**
   - Slowly lower your body back down to the starting position by bending the knee of the stepping foot and controlling the movement.

7. **Repeat:**
   - Alternate between legs, maintaining form throughout.

## Key Tips
