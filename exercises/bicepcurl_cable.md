### Equipment Needed
- Cable machine with a low pulley
- Straight bar attachment or rope attachment

### Starting Position
1. **Setup**: Attach a straight bar or rope to the low pulley on the cable machine.
2. **Positioning**: Stand facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart.
3. **Grab the Bar**: Bend at the elbows and grasp the bar/rope with an underhand grip (palms facing up).

### Proper Form
1. **Elbow Position**: Keep your elbows close to your torso throughout the movement.
2. **Body Posture**: Stand tall with a slight bend in your knees. Engage your core.
3. **Curl Movement**:
   - Pull the bar/rope towards your shoulders, keeping your elbows stationary.
   - Curl until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar/rope reaches shoulder height.

### Return Phase
1. **Lowering**: Slowly lower the bar/rope back to the starting position with control.
2. **Full Extension**: Allow your arms to extend fully but don't lock out your elbows.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Avoid swinging or using momentum; the movement should be smooth and controlled.
- Focus on squeezing your biceps at the peak of the curl.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position to avoid strain.

### Common Mistakes
- Not keeping elbows stationary.
- Lifting too heavy, leading to poor form.
- Letting shoulders rise during the curl.

Following these guidelines will help ensure you perform the Cable Bicep Curl with proper form, maximizing effectiveness and reducing the risk of injury.
