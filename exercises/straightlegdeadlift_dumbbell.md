---

## Setup
1. **Starting Position**: Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Let the weights hang in front of your thighs, palms facing your body.

## Execution
2. **Hinge at the Hips**: Keeping your knees slightly bent, push your hips back while lowering the dumbbells along the front of your legs. Maintain a flat back throughout the motion.

3. **Lowering the Dumbbells**: Allow the dumbbells to descend to just below your knees or as far as your hamstrings allow without rounding your back.

4. **Core Engagement**: Keep your core tight to support your spine.

5. **Return to Start**: Drive through your heels, pushing your hips forward as you rise back to standing. Squeeze your glutes at the top.

## Tips
- **Back Position**: Maintain a straight back; avoid rounding your shoulders.
- **Neck Alignment**: Keep your head in a neutral position, looking forward or slightly down.
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering the dumbbells, and exhale while returning to standing.

## Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back when lowering or lifting.
- Overextending the knees.
- Lifting weights that are too heavy, leading to compromised form. 

By following these steps, you'll effectively perform the Dumbbell Straight Leg Deadlift while minimizing injury risk and maximizing effectiveness.
