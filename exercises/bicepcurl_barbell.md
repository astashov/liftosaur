## Starting Position
1. **Grip**: Stand up straight while holding a barbell with an underhand grip (palms facing up) at shoulder-width apart.
2. **Posture**: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, elbows close to your torso, and spine neutral.

## Execution
1. **Lift**: Curl the barbell upward by bending your elbows, bringing the barbell towards your shoulders.
2. **Control**: Keep your upper arms stationary and avoid leaning back or swinging the body.
3. **Top Position**: Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement without locking your elbows.

## Lowering Phase
1. **Lower**: Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.
2. **Reset**: Ensure your elbows remain close to your torso during the descent.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Swinging**: Avoid using momentum; focus on isolated movement of the biceps.
- **Elbow Movement**: Keep elbows fixed to prevent shoulder engagement.
- **Body Position**: Maintain an upright posture; do not lean back.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Exhale while lifting, inhale while lowering.
- **Focus**: Concentrate on the biceps during the entire movement for maximum engagement.
