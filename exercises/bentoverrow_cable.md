description: "Strengthen the upper back and lats with the Cable Bent Over Row, using constant cable tension in a hinged position to target back muscles and biceps."
---

**Starting Position:**
1. Set the cable pulley at the lowest position.
2. Attach a handle to the cable.
3. Stand facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart.
4. Grip the handle with both hands, palms facing each other (neutral grip).
5. Slightly bend your knees and hinge at your hips, keeping your back straight and torso bent forward at about a 45-degree angle.

**Execution:**
1. **Pull:** Engage your core and pull the handle towards your lower rib cage, keeping your elbows close to your body.
2. **Squeeze:** At the peak of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
3. **Lower:** Slowly extend your arms, letting the handle return to the starting position, maintaining tension in your back.
4. **Breath:** Exhale as you pull and inhale as you lower the weight.

**Key Points:**
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid rounding your back; keep your chest up.
- Control both the pulling and lowering phases to ensure muscle engagement.
- Keep your shoulders relaxed, focusing on using your back muscles.

### Common Mistakes:
- Rounding the back.
- Using momentum for the pull instead of muscle strength.
- Flaring elbows out too wide.

Focus on proper form to maximize effectiveness and reduce injury risk.

### Set Up the Cable
Set the cable pulley to the lowest position and attach a handle. Stand facing the machine, grip the handle with a neutral grip (palms facing each other), and hinge at the hips to about 45 degrees.

### Brace and Position
Keep your knees slightly bent, back straight, and core engaged. Maintain a neutral spine before pulling.

### Pull to the Lower Ribs
Drive the handle toward your lower ribcage with elbows close to your body. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the peak of the movement.

### Lower with Tension
Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position while maintaining cable tension. Exhale as you pull and inhale as you lower.
