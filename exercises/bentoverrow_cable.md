**Starting Position:**
1. Set the cable pulley at the lowest position.
2. Attach a handle to the cable.
3. Stand facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart.
4. Grip the handle with both hands, palms facing each other (neutral grip).
5. Slightly bend your knees and hinge at your hips, keeping your back straight and torso bent forward at about a 45-degree angle.

**Execution:**
1. **Pull:** Engage your core and pull the handle towards your lower rib cage, keeping your elbows close to your body.
2. **Squeeze:** At the peak of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
3. **Lower:** Slowly extend your arms, letting the handle return to the starting position, maintaining tension in your back.
4. **Breath:** Exhale as you pull and inhale as you lower the weight.

**Key Points:**
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid rounding your back; keep your chest up.
- Control both the pulling and lowering phases to ensure muscle engagement.
- Keep your shoulders relaxed, focusing on using your back muscles. 

### Common Mistakes:
- Rounding the back.
- Using momentum for the pull instead of muscle strength.
- Flaring elbows out too wide.

Focus on proper form to maximize effectiveness and reduce injury risk.
