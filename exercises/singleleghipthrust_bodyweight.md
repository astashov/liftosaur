### Setup
1. **Positioning**: Sit on the ground with your upper back against a bench or elevated surface.
2. **Leg Placement**: Bend one knee and place that foot flat on the ground. Extend the opposite leg straight out.

#### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body.
2. **Lift Hips**: Push through the heel of the foot that is on the ground, raising your hips towards the ceiling.
3. **Alignment**: Keep your shoulders, hips, and knee of the grounded leg in line at the top of the movement.
4. **Hold**: At the top, your body should form a straight line from your shoulders to the knee of the grounded leg.
5. **Lower**: Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position without touching the ground.

#### Tips for Proper Form
- **Foot Placement**: Ensure the grounded foot is close enough that your knee stays aligned with your ankle.
- **Controlled Movement**: Perform the lift and lower slowly to maximize muscle engagement.
- **Avoid Overarching**: Do not overarch your lower back; keep your pelvis tucked.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Wrong Foot Position**: Placing the foot too far or too close can cause strain.
- **Speed**: Performing the exercise too quickly can reduce effectiveness and increase injury risk.
- **Hip Rotation**: Avoid letting your hips roll outward; keep them as stable as possible.

### Summary
Maintain proper alignment and control throughout the movement for optimal engagement and safety.
