### Setup
1. **Start Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Dumbbell Position**: Hold a dumbbell in one hand, palms facing your body.
3. **Bend Forward**: Hinge at your hips and slightly bend your knees to lower your torso. Keep your back straight, nearly parallel to the ground.
4. **Support Yourself**: Use your other hand to support your body on a bench or your knee.

### Execution
1. **Pull**: Engage your core and bring the dumbbell towards your hip, keeping your elbow close to your body.
2. **Squeeze**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blade to maximize contraction.
3. **Lower**: Slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position, maintaining control.

### Tips
- Keep your head in a neutral position, aligned with your spine.
- Avoid rounding your back; maintain a straight posture.
- Perform the movement in a controlled manner to focus on muscle engagement.

### Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back instead of keeping it flat.
- Using momentum rather than muscle strength.
- Letting the elbow flare out instead of keeping it close to the body.

### Hinge and Support
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hinge at the hips until your torso is nearly parallel to the ground. Place your free hand on a bench or your knee for support.

### Set the Starting Position
Hold a dumbbell in the working hand with palm facing your body. Keep your back flat and core engaged before pulling.

### Pull to the Hip
Drive the dumbbell toward your hip, keeping your elbow close to your body. Squeeze your shoulder blade at the top of the movement for maximum contraction.

### Lower with Control
Slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position, fully extending your arm. Avoid using momentum or rounding your back between reps.
