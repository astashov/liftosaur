### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a flat bench and a pair of dumbbells.
2. **Positioning**: Sit on the bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.

### Execution
1. **Lying Back**: Lie back on the bench, simultaneously bringing the dumbbells to your chest.
2. **Grip**: Hold the dumbbells with palms facing forward (neutral grip) or slightly turned in (45-degree angle).
3. **Feet Placement**: Keep your feet flat on the floor for stability.

### Movement
1. **Starting Position**: Press the dumbbells up over your chest, extending your arms fully while keeping the elbows slightly bent.
2. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower the dumbbells down to the sides of your chest, maintaining control.
3. **Wrist Alignment**: Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms throughout the motion.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Shoulder Blades**: Keep your shoulder blades retracted and pressed into the bench.
- **Back Position**: Maintain a neutral spine; avoid arching your lower back excessively.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while pressing the weights up and inhale while lowering them.

### Common Mistakes
- **Flared Elbows**: Avoid letting your elbows flare out excessively; they should stay at around a 45-degree angle to your body.
- **Bouncing**: Do not bounce the weights off your chest; perform a controlled movement.
- **Inconsistent Range**: Ensure you lower the dumbbells to chest level for full range of motion.

### Conclusion
Performing the Dumbbell Bench Press with proper form enhances safety and effectiveness, targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps efficiently.
