### Starting Position
1. **Select a Dumbbell:** Choose an appropriate weight for your fitness level.
2. **Body Position:** Stand or sit on a bench with back support. Keep your back straight and core engaged.
3. **Grip the Dumbbell:** Hold a single dumbbell with both hands. Your thumbs should wrap around the handle and fingers grip the body of the dumbbell.

### Execution
1. **Raise the Dumbbell:** Extend your arms overhead, keeping your elbows close to your ears. This is the starting position.
2. **Lower the Dumbbell:** Slowly bend your elbows to lower the dumbbell behind your head. Keep your elbows stationary and pointed forward.
3. **Full Range of Motion:** Go as low as comfortable without straining, ideally until your forearms touch the upper arms.
4. **Lift the Dumbbell:** Engage your triceps to straighten your arms back to the starting position. Exhale as you lift.

### Key Tips
- **Elbow Alignment:** Keep elbows close to your head and avoid flaring them out.
- **Controlled Movement:** Perform each rep in a slow and controlled manner to maintain tension on the triceps.
- **Avoid Locking Elbows:** Do not fully lock your elbows at the top to prevent joint strain.

### Common Mistakes
- Flaring elbows outwards.
- Using momentum instead of muscle engagement.
- Not maintaining a neutral spine. 

### Conclusion
Focus on proper form to maximize the effectiveness of the Dumbbell Triceps Extension and prevent injury.
