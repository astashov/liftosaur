## Starting Position
1. Stand upright, feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.

## Execution Steps
1. **Step Back**: Shift your weight onto one leg and step back with the opposite leg, lowering your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle.
2. **Lowering Phase**: Ensure your front knee stays over your ankle and does not extend beyond your toes.
3. **Front Leg Focus**: Keep your torso upright and engage your core throughout the movement.
4. **Return**: Push through the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position, bringing the back leg forward.

## Key Points
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout.
- Don't let your back knee touch the ground; just hover above it.
- Keep your head up and look forward.
- Alternate legs with each repetition.

## Tips
- Choose an appropriate weight to maintain control and form.
- Ensure your movements are smooth and deliberate.
