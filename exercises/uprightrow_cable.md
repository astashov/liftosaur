## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a straight bar attachment.
2. **Height Adjustment**: Set the cable at the lowest position.

## Execution
1. **Grip**: Stand facing the machine, grasp the bar with both hands (shoulder-width apart), using an overhand grip.
2. **Starting Position**: Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart, arms extended in front of you, and elbows slightly bent.
3. **Lift**: Pull the cable upwards towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
4. **Position at Peak**: Keep the bar close to your body; your elbows should be higher than your wrists at the top position.
5. **Lower**: Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

## Tips
- **Posture**: Keep your chest up and back straight; avoid leaning back.
- **Movement**: Focus on the shoulder muscles, using a controlled motion without jerking.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while lifting and inhale while lowering.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting too heavy, causing poor form.
- Letting elbows drop below wrists at the peak.
- Using momentum instead of muscle control.

Maintaining proper form ensures effectiveness and reduces the risk of injury.
