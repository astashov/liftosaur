---

### Setup:
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band and a sturdy anchor point.
2. **Positioning the Band**: Secure one end of the band to the anchor and hold the other end in your hand. Step back to create tension in the band while standing upright.

### Execution:
1. **Foot Placement**: Stand with one foot forward and the other foot behind you, resting on the toes of the back foot.
2. **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight and maintain a neutral spine.
3. **Lowering Phase**: Bend your front knee to lower your body, keeping the knee aligned over the ankle. The back knee should move towards the floor without touching it.
4. **Depth**: Go as low as comfortable while maintaining form, ideally until the front thigh is parallel to the ground.
5. **Returning Phase**: Press through the front heel to rise back to the starting position.

### Tips:
- **Alignment**: Ensure proper knee alignment; do not let the knee collapse inward.
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering, exhale while rising.
- **Control**: Move slowly and controlled to maximize tension in the muscles and reduce injury risk. 

### Common Mistakes:
- Allowing the front knee to extend past the toes.
- Leaning forward excessively.
- Not engaging the core, which can lead to back strain.

### Progressions:
- Increase band resistance or change foot positioning for difficulty.

Following this guide will help you perform the Band Split Squat with proper form, maximizing benefits and minimizing injury risk.

### Anchor and Stand
Secure a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and hold the other end. Step back to create tension in the band and stand upright with a neutral spine.

### Assume the Split Stance
Place one foot forward and one foot back, resting on the toes of the rear foot. Keep your core tight and maintain an upright torso before lowering.

### Descend
Bend your front knee to lower your body, keeping the knee aligned over the ankle and not caving inward. The back knee should travel toward the floor without touching it.

### Drive Back Up
Press through the front heel to return to the starting position. Inhale while lowering and exhale while rising. Complete all reps, then switch legs.
