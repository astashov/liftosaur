### Setup:
1. **Equipment**: Barbell, bench or mat.
2. **Positioning**: Sit on the floor with your back against the bench, knees bent, and feet flat on the ground.

#### Steps:
1. **Load the Barbell**: Place the desired weight on the barbell and position it over your hips.
2. **Barbell Placement**: Lie back on the bench with the barbell resting just above your hips. Ensure your shoulder blades are on the bench.
3. **Foot Position**: Feet should be shoulder-width apart, about a foot away from the bench. Toes can point slightly outward.
4. **Engage Core**: Brace your core to stabilize your spine.

#### Execution:
1. **Lift Hips**: Press through your heels, pushing your hips upward until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees.
2. **Squeeze Glutes**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your glutes and pause briefly.
3. **Lower Down**: Slowly lower your hips back down, returning to the starting position while maintaining control.
4. **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower down, exhale as you lift.

#### Tips:
- Keep your neck neutral; do not let it strain by lifting your head.
- Ensure knees do not cave inward; they should track over your toes.
- Avoid hyperextending your lower back; focus on using glutes for lift.
- Use a mat or padding for comfort under the barbell if necessary.

#### Common Mistakes:
- Inadequate hip extension (not reaching a straight line).
- Lifting excessively with the lower back (instead of engaging glutes).
- Feet positioned too far or too close to the bench.

Make sure to focus on maintaining proper form to maximize effectiveness and minimize injury risk.
