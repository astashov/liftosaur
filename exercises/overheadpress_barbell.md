### Setup
1. **Starting Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grip the barbell with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width.
2. **Bar Position**: Rest the barbell on your upper chest, just below your chin, with your elbows positioned slightly in front of the bar.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your spine.
2. **Press**: Push the barbell overhead while keeping your wrists straight and elbows in line with your wrists.
3. **Full Extension**: Extend your arms fully without locking the elbows at the top. Your arms should be in line with your ears.
4. **Controlled Descent**: Lower the barbell back to the starting position without leaning back excessively or hunching your shoulders. 

### Tips
- **Head Position**: Tuck your chin slightly to allow the bar to travel straight up.
- **Spine Alignment**: Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- **Foot Placement**: Keep your feet planted and balanced to avoid swaying.

### Common Mistakes
- **Arching Back**: Avoid excessive arching; keep your hips and core engaged.
- **Wrist Position**: Keep wrists straight, not bent back.
- **Inadequate Range of Motion**: Ensure full extension and a complete downward motion.
