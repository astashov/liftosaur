**Equipment Needed:**
- Dumbbells
- Flat bench

**Setup:**
1. Lie on your back on a flat bench, feet planted on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended above your chest, palms facing each other.

**Execution:**
1. **Lowering Phase:**
   - With a slight bend in your elbows, slowly lower the dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc.
   - Keep your elbows fixed and lower until you feel a stretch in your chest, not exceeding shoulder level.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Reverse the motion by bringing the dumbbells back together over your chest, maintaining the slight bend in your elbows.
   - Focus on squeezing your chest as you lift the dumbbells back to the starting position.

**Tips for Proper Form:**
- Keep your shoulders down and avoid arching your back.
- Maintain a controlled tempo; avoid using momentum.
- Breathe out as you lift and breathe in as you lower.
- Keep your wrists neutral and avoid excessive bending.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Lifting too heavy, which can compromise form.
- Lowering the dumbbells too far, risking shoulder injury.
- Allowing elbows to flare out excessively or to droop down.

**Overall Focus:**
- Concentrate on the contraction of the chest muscles throughout the movement.
