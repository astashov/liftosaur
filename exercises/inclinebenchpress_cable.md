### Setup
1. **Equipment Needed**: Cable machine with an adjustable incline bench.
2. **Bench Position**: Adjust the incline bench to about 30-45 degrees.
3. **Cable Setup**: Position the pulleys at the lowest settings on both sides of the cable machine.

### Execution
1. **Grip the Cables**: Sit on the bench, holding the cable handles with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
2. **Position Yourself**: Lean back on the bench, ensuring your head, shoulders, and buttocks are in contact with the surface.
3. **Starting Position**: Pull the cables down to the sides of your chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
4. **Press**: Push the handles upward in a controlled motion, extending your arms but not locking your elbows at the top.
5. **Return**: Slowly lower the handles back to the starting position, maintaining tension in the cables.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.
- Avoid arching your back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Ensure the movement is controlled; avoid using momentum.
- Focus on squeezing your chest at the top of the press.

### Common Mistakes
- Letting the elbows flare out excessively.
- Not maintaining a stable body position.
- Using too much weight, compromising form.

### Benefits
- Targets upper chest muscles effectively.
- Provides constant tension due to cable resistance.

### Safety
- Use a weight that allows for proper form.
- Avoid rapid movements to reduce risk of injury.
