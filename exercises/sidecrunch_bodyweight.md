### Assume the Starting Position
Lie on your side with legs stacked and knees bent at 90 degrees. Rest your bottom arm under your head and place your top hand on your hip or behind your head.

### Engage and Lift
Tighten your core, then exhale and lift your torso toward your hip by contracting the oblique muscles. Bring your top elbow toward your top knee.

### Hold the Crunch
Pause briefly at the top of the movement to maximize oblique engagement before returning.

### Lower with Control
Inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position. Perform all reps on one side, then switch sides for balanced development.
