- Focus on driving through the hips and engaging the entire body during the slam.

### Set the Starting Position
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold the medicine ball overhead with arms fully extended. Engage your core.

### Generate Power
Bend at the hips and knees as you bring the ball downward. Use your entire body — legs, core, and upper body — to generate force rather than relying only on your arms.

### Slam the Ball
Drive the ball forcefully into the ground directly in front of you. Allow your arms to follow through naturally as the ball makes contact.

### Reset and Repeat
Bend your knees slightly to absorb the impact as you retrieve the ball. Return to the overhead starting position and repeat with full control.
