### Set Up the Plank
Lie on your side with legs straight and stacked. Place your elbow directly underneath your shoulder to form your base of support.

### Lift the Hips
Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground so your body forms a straight line from head to heels. Avoid letting the hips sag or arch.

### Hold the Position
Breathe steadily while maintaining the plank. Keep your neck neutral and your torso from rotating forward or backward.

### Build Duration Progressively
Hold for the target time, then lower your hips under control. Begin with shorter holds and gradually increase duration as oblique and core strength improves.
