**Starting Position:**
1. Lie on your side with your legs straight and stacked on top of each other.
2. Position your elbow directly underneath your shoulder to support your body.

**Execution:**
1. Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground.
2. Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
3. Ensure that your neck is in a neutral position, not tilted up or down.
4. Hold the position, maintaining tension in your core and avoiding sagging or arching your hips.

**Breathing:**
- Breathe steadily while holding the position. 

**Common Mistakes:**
- Dropping the hips towards the ground.
- Twisting the torso or letting it rotate forward or backward.
- Not aligning the elbow with the shoulder.

**Tips:**

- Feel free to modify by resting the knee on the ground for support if needed.
