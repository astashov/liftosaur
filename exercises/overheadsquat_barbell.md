## Setup
1. **Bar Position**: Start with the barbell on your upper back in a back squat position. 
2. **Grip**: Use a wide grip on the bar. Elbows should be extended.
3. **Foot Placement**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward.

## Execution
1. **Lift Off**: Press the bar overhead, stabilizing it with your arms locked out and straight.
2. **Squatting down**: Begin to squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
3. **Depth**: Lower your body until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground or lower, keeping the bar directly over your center of gravity.
4. **Maintain Form**: Keep your chest up, back straight, and core engaged throughout the movement.
5. **Knees Alignment**: Ensure your knees track over your toes without collapsing inward.

## Rising Up
1. **Push Through Heels**: Drive through your heels to stand back up.
2. **Return**: Return to the starting position while maintaining the bar overhead.

## Key Points
- **Core Stability**: Keep your core tight to stabilize the torso.
- **Wrist Position**: Wrists should be straight and in line with the bar.
- **Breathing**: Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way up.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the bar to drift forward.
- Losing balance or leaning forward excessively.
- Not achieving sufficient squat depth.

Ensure proper technique is followed to maximize benefits and minimize injury risks.
