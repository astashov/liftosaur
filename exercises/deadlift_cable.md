### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Attach a straight bar handle to the low pulley of a cable machine.
2. **Positioning**: Stand facing the cable machine. Position your feet shoulder-width apart and grip the bar with both hands.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Bend at your hips and knees to lower your torso. Keep your back straight and chest lifted. Grab the bar with an overhand grip.
2. **Lift Off**: Engage your core, push through your heels, and extend your hips and knees to lift the bar. Keep it close to your body as you rise to a standing position.
3. **Top Position**: Stand upright with your shoulders back and arms extended, maintaining a neutral spine.
4. **Descent**: Lower the bar back down by bending at the hips first, then the knees. Keep your back straight throughout the movement.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine to prevent injury.
- Control the movement; avoid jerking or using momentum.
- Focus on engaging the posterior chain (back, glutes, hamstrings) during the lift.
