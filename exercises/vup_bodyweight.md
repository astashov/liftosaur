## Starting Position
1. Lie flat on your back with your arms extended overhead and legs straight.
2. Keep your core engaged and ensure your lower back is pressed into the ground.

## Movement
1. **Lift Shoulders and Legs**: As you exhale, raise your arms and legs simultaneously towards the ceiling while keeping them straight.
2. **Form the "V" Shape**: Aim to lift your torso and legs to form a V position. Keep your core tight to maintain balance.
3. **Touch Toes**: Reach your hands towards your feet at the peak of the movement. 

## Return
1. **Lower Back Down**: Inhale as you slowly lower your arms and legs back to the starting position without letting them touch the ground.
2. **Maintain Control**: Keep the movement controlled, focusing on engaging your core throughout.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Avoid arching your lower back; ensure it remains in contact with the ground.
- Keep your neck relaxed and avoid straining it during the lift.
- Control the movement speed to maximize tension in the core.

## Key Points
- Engage your core throughout the exercise.
- Focus on creating a smooth, fluid motion without jerking.
- Modify by bending knees if necessary for beginners.
