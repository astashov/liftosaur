## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Sit down and adjust the backrest and seat height so your knees form a 90-degree angle when your feet are on the platform.
2. **Foot Placement**: Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, ensuring your toes point slightly outward.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Push against the platform with your heels to lift the weight stack slightly off the safety locks.
2. **Descent**: Slowly lower the platform by bending your knees, keeping your back flat against the seat.
3. **Knee Alignment**: Ensure your knees track over your toes and do not collapse inward.
4. **Depth**: Lower until your thighs are parallel to the platform or to a comfortable range.
5. **Ascent**: Press through your heels and extend your legs to return to the starting position, fully extending but not locking your knees.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid lifting your feet off the platform during the exercise.
- Focus on controlled movements for both ascent and descent.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing knees to cave in.
- Rounding the back.
- Locking the knees at the top of the movement. 

By following these guidelines, you'll perform the seated leg press effectively and safely.
