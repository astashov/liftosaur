## Setup
1. **Stance**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Kettlebell Position**: Hold a kettlebell in one hand at shoulder height, with your elbow close to your body. The palm should face you, and the kettlebell should rest on your forearm.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to maintain stability.
2. **Leg Drive**: Slightly bend your knees and push through your heels to generate force.
3. **Press Up**: Extend your arm overhead, pressing the kettlebell upwards while using your legs to help drive the movement.
4. **Finish Position**: Lock your elbow at the top and keep your wrist straight. The kettlebell should be above your shoulder, with the arm extended.
5. **Lowering**: Reverse the motion by lowering the kettlebell back to shoulder height with control.

## Tips
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning back excessively.
- Ensure your wrist stays neutral throughout the movement.
- Focus on an explosive movement while maintaining control.

## Common Mistakes
- Letting the kettlebell drift too far away from the body.
- Using too much back and not engaging the legs properly.
- Neglecting core engagement and stability. 

Follow these steps for proper form to maximize effectiveness and minimize injury risk.
