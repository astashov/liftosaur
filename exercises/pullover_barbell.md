### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and a bench.
2. **Positioning**: Lie on a flat bench with your upper back and shoulders supported. Your feet should be flat on the floor.

### Grip
1. **Hand Placement**: Grab the barbell with both hands, using an overhand grip. Hands should be slightly wider than shoulder-width.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Hold the bar overhead with straight arms, perpendicular to your body.
2. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower the barbell behind your head in an arc, keeping your elbows slightly bent. Descend until you feel a stretch in your chest and lats.
3. **Returning Phase**: Push through your chest and bring the barbell back to the starting position, following the same arc. Keep your core engaged to maintain stability.

### Tips
- **Maintain Control**: Perform the movement in a controlled manner to avoid injury.
- **Focus on Range of Motion**: Lower only as far as comfortable, ensuring you feel a stretch without straining.
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the barbell and exhale as you lift it back up.

### Common Mistakes
1. **Overextending**: Avoid going too low, which can strain the shoulders.
2. **Using Momentum**: Don’t rely on swinging; focus on muscle engagement.
3. **Arched Back**: Keep your back flat against the bench to maintain proper form.
