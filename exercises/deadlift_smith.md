## Setup
1. **Positioning the Bar**: Set the Smith machine bar to mid-shin level.
2. **Foot Placement**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Ensure the bar is over the midfoot.

## Grip
1. **Hand Placement**: Grasp the bar with both hands, just outside your knees. Use either an overhand grip or a mixed grip.

## Starting Position
1. **Knees and Hips**: Bend at the knees and hips, keeping your back straight and chest up.
2. **Shoulders**: Pull your shoulders back and down, engaging your lats.

## Execution
1. **Lift Off**: Drive through your heels and push the bar upward by extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
2. **Body Alignment**: Keep the bar close to your body throughout the movement. Your back should remain neutral, avoiding rounding or excessive arching.

## Completion
1. **Standing Position**: Stand fully upright with your shoulders back at the top of the lift.
2. **Lowering the Bar**: In a controlled manner, reverse the movement by pushing your hips back first, then bending your knees to lower the bar back to the starting position.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering and exhale while lifting.
- **Range of Motion**: Ensure you're maintaining full range of motion without compromising form.
- **Focus**: Keep your core engaged throughout the lift for stability.

By following these steps, you can perform the Smith Machine Deadlift with proper form for effective training.
