## Starting Position
- Stand facing a bench or step with a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
- Feet should be hip-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Step Up**: Place your right foot firmly on the bench/step.
2. **Drive Up**: Push through your right heel to lift your body upward, bringing your left knee up towards your chest.
3. **Top Position**: Stand tall on the bench/step with your right leg fully extended.
4. **Step Down**: Lower your left leg back to the ground while keeping your right foot planted.
5. **Repeat**: Alternate legs after each set or complete all reps on one side before switching.

## Tips for Proper Form

- Ensure your knee does not extend past your toes during the step-up.
- Maintain a neutral spine and avoid leaning forward.

## Common Mistakes
