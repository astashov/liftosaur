## Setup
1. **Position the Kettlebell**: Hold a kettlebell in one hand. You can either hold it at chest level (rack position) or let it hang beside you.
2. **Stance**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Step one foot back about 2-3 feet into a lunge position.

## Execution
1. **Lowering**: 
   - Bend your front knee and lower your back knee toward the floor.
   - Keep your torso upright and your front knee aligned over your ankle.
   - Lower until your back knee nearly touches the ground.

2. **Rising**:
   - Push through your front heel to return to the starting position.
   - Keep your core engaged and maintain a stable posture throughout.

## Key Points
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower, exhale as you rise.
- **Alignment**: Ensure your front knee does not go beyond your toes.
- **Balance**: Keep weight evenly distributed through your front foot while maintaining stability.

## Common Mistakes
- Leaning forward excessively.
- Allowing the front knee to collapse inward.
- Not engaging the core.

## Modifications
- Use a lighter kettlebell if form is compromised.
- Perform the exercise without the kettlebell to master the movement first.
