## Setup
1. **Position the Kettlebell**: Hold a kettlebell in one hand. You can either hold it at chest level (rack position) or let it hang beside you.
2. **Stance**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Step one foot back about 2-3 feet into a lunge position.

## Execution
1. **Lowering**: 
   - Bend your front knee and lower your back knee toward the floor.
   - Keep your torso upright and your front knee aligned over your ankle.
   - Lower until your back knee nearly touches the ground.

2. **Rising**:
   - Push through your front heel to return to the starting position.
   - Keep your core engaged and maintain a stable posture throughout.

## Key Points
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower, exhale as you rise.
- **Alignment**: Ensure your front knee does not go beyond your toes.
- **Balance**: Keep weight evenly distributed through your front foot while maintaining stability.

## Common Mistakes
- Leaning forward excessively.
- Allowing the front knee to collapse inward.
- Not engaging the core.

## Modifications
- Use a lighter kettlebell if form is compromised.
- Perform the exercise without the kettlebell to master the movement first.

### Set Up with the Kettlebell
Hold a kettlebell in one hand either in the rack position at chest level or hanging at your side. Stand with feet hip-width apart and step one foot back about 2-3 feet into a lunge position.

### Lower into the Split Squat
Bend your front knee and lower your back knee toward the floor. Keep your torso upright, front knee aligned over your ankle, and core engaged throughout.

### Reach the Bottom Position
Lower until your back knee nearly touches the ground. Avoid letting the front knee collapse inward or the torso lean excessively forward.

### Drive Back Up
Press through your front heel to return to the starting position. Keep your core stable and posture upright. Inhale as you lower and exhale as you rise. Complete all reps before switching sides.
