description: "Isolate the biceps with the Band Concentration Curl by bracing your elbow on your inner thigh and curling the band upward in a strict, controlled motion."
---

### Equipment Needed
- Resistance band

### Steps

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Sit on a bench or chair with legs spread.
   - Place one end of the resistance band under your foot and hold the other end with the opposite hand.

2. **Hand Placement**:
   - Position your elbow against the inside of your thigh. This stabilizes your arm and isolates the bicep.

3. **Curl Motion**:
   - Keeping your upper arm stationary, curl the band upwards by bending your elbow.
   - Focus on squeezing your bicep at the top of the movement.

4. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Slowly lower the band back to the starting position, maintaining tension in the band throughout.

5. **Repetitions**:
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

### Form Tips
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning.
- Control the movement, ensuring no momentum is used.
- Maintain steady breathing: exhale on the curl, inhale as you lower.

### Common Mistakes
- Letting the elbow drift away from the thigh, which reduces isolation.
- Using too much body movement or momentum to complete the curl.
- Failing to maintain tension in the band during the entire movement.

### Benefits
- Targets the biceps specifically.
- Can be done anywhere with minimal equipment.

### Set Up Your Position
Sit on a bench with legs spread and one end of the resistance band under your foot. Hold the other end with the opposite hand.

### Brace Your Elbow
Press your elbow firmly against the inside of your thigh to stabilize your upper arm. This isolates the bicep and prevents swinging.

### Curl Upward
Keeping your upper arm stationary, curl the band toward your shoulder by bending your elbow. Squeeze your bicep at the top of the movement.

### Lower and Repeat
Slowly lower the band back to full extension while maintaining tension throughout. Complete your reps on one arm before switching sides.
