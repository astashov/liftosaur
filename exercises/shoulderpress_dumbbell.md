## Setup
1. **Starting Position**: Stand or sit on a bench with back support. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing forward.

## Execution
2. **Grip**: Keep your wrists straight and elbows slightly in front of your body.
3. **Press**: Push the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended, but do not lock your elbows. Maintain a straight line from your wrists to your shoulders.
4. **Control**: Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position at shoulder height in a controlled manner.

## Form Tips
- **Core Engagement**: Keep your core tight to maintain stability.
- **Avoid Arching**: Do not arch your back; keep your torso upright.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while lifting the weights and inhale while lowering them.

## Common Mistakes
- **Flared Elbows**: Keep elbows close to your body.
- **Using Momentum**: Avoid bouncing weights; focus on controlled movement.

By following these steps, you'll ensure proper form and maximize the effectiveness of the Dumbbell Shoulder Press.
