### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with the pulley set at waist height.
2. **Position**: Stand side-on to the machine, feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the cable handle with both hands, arms extended and slightly bent.

### Execution
1. **Initial Position**: Rotate your torso away from the machine, keeping your feet planted. Engage your core.
2. **Twisting Motion**: Pull the cable across your body by twisting your torso towards the machine while keeping your arms straight. 
3. **End Position**: Reach the peak of the twist, ensuring your hips remain stable and your shoulders are aligned.
4. **Return**: Slowly reverse the motion to return to the starting position in a controlled manner, maintaining tension in your core throughout.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Engage Core**: Keep your abdominal muscles tightened during the entire movement.
- **Controlled Movement**: Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled twists.
- **Knees Soft**: Maintain a slight bend in your knees to stabilize your lower body.
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you rotate and exhale during the twist.

### Common Mistakes
- **Leaning Back**: Avoid arching your back; keep a neutral spine.
- **Fast Movements**: Don’t rush through; slow, controlled motions are key.
- **Over-Rotating**: Ensure the twist is coming from your torso, not just your arms.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Bodyweight Cable Twist effectively while minimizing the risk of injury.
