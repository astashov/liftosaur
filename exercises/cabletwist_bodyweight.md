### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with the pulley set at waist height.
2. **Position**: Stand side-on to the machine, feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the cable handle with both hands, arms extended and slightly bent.

### Execution
1. **Initial Position**: Rotate your torso away from the machine, keeping your feet planted. Engage your core.
2. **Twisting Motion**: Pull the cable across your body by twisting your torso towards the machine while keeping your arms straight.
3. **End Position**: Reach the peak of the twist, ensuring your hips remain stable and your shoulders are aligned.
4. **Return**: Slowly reverse the motion to return to the starting position in a controlled manner, maintaining tension in your core throughout.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Engage Core**: Keep your abdominal muscles tightened during the entire movement.
- **Controlled Movement**: Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled twists.
- **Knees Soft**: Maintain a slight bend in your knees to stabilize your lower body.
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you rotate and exhale during the twist.

### Common Mistakes
- **Leaning Back**: Avoid arching your back; keep a neutral spine.
- **Fast Movements**: Don't rush through; slow, controlled motions are key.
- **Over-Rotating**: Ensure the twist is coming from your torso, not just your arms.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Bodyweight Cable Twist effectively while minimizing the risk of injury.

### Stand Side-On to the Machine
Set the cable pulley to waist height. Stand perpendicular to the machine, feet shoulder-width apart, holding the handle with both hands and arms extended with a slight bend.

### Engage Core and Set Your Position
Rotate your torso slightly away from the machine as your starting position. Engage your core and keep your hips stable and feet planted.

### Twist Across Your Body
Pull the cable across your body by rotating your torso toward and past the machine's starting side. Keep your arms straight and drive the movement from your core rather than your arms.

### Return Under Control
Slowly reverse the twist back to the starting position, maintaining core tension throughout. Keep knees slightly bent and avoid arching your back.
