### Equipment Needed

### Setup
1. **Choose the Band**: Select an appropriate resistance band.
2. **Anchor the Band**: Stand on the band with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the handles or ends.

### Starting Position
1. **Grip**: Hold the band with palms facing up, arms fully extended down at your sides.
2. **Posture**: Stand tall with a straight back and core engaged.

### Execution
1. **Curl**: Flex your elbows and curl your hands toward your shoulders while keeping elbows close to your body.
2. **Full Range**: Ensure you fully extend your arms back to the starting position after each curl.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Control Movement**: Avoid using momentum; perform the exercise slowly and with control.
- **Keep Wrists Straight**: Ensure your wrists remain straight throughout the movement.
- **Engage Core**: Maintain a tight core for stability.
- **Avoid Swinging**: Keep your body still; only your arms should move.

### Common Mistakes
- **Elbows Flared Out**: Keep elbows tucked in to the sides.
- **Using Too Much Momentum**: Focus on controlled movements rather than swinging.
- **Inadequate Range of Motion**: Fully extend and contract your arms for effectiveness.
