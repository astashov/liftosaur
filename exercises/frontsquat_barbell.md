---

### Starting Position
1. **Bar Placement**: Position the barbell on your anterior deltoids, crossing your arms to create a shelf. You may also use a clean grip (hands slightly wider than shoulder-width).
2. **Feet Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly pointed out.
3. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core and keep your back straight.

### Execution
1. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Begin the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously.
   - Keep your elbows high and chest up throughout the movement.
   - Descend until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground or lower if flexibility allows.

2. **Ascending Phase**:
   - Push through your heels to rise back up.
   - Keep your core engaged and maintain an upright torso.
   - Fully extend your hips and knees at the top of the movement.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Knees Tracking**: Ensure your knees are tracking over your toes during the squat.
- **Hip Awareness**: Avoid letting your hips shoot back too early; maintain upright posture.
- **Breathing**: Inhale on the way down, exhale as you push up.
- **Focus on Stability**: Keep your weight evenly distributed across your feet.

### Common Mistakes
- Leaning forward excessively.
- Allowing elbows to drop.
- Bouncing at the bottom of the squat.

### Safety Considerations
- Use a squat rack for heavier loads.
- Consider using a spotter or safety bars if lifting heavy.
- Ensure proper mobility before performing this exercise.
