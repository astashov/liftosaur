### Setup
1. **Choose the Right EZ Bar**: Select an EZ bar with comfortable grip locations.
2. **Position Yourself**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. If using a bench, sit with a straight back.

### Grip
- **Hand Placement**: Grip the EZ bar at the angled portions, typically shoulder-width apart or slightly wider.
- **Wrist Position**: Keep wrists in a neutral position without excessive bending.

### Starting Position
- **Bar Position**: Raise the bar to shoulder height, elbows slightly in front of the bar, and engage your core.

### Execution
1. **Press Upward**: Push the bar overhead while maintaining a straight line from your wrists to your shoulders.
2. **Full Extension**: Extend arms fully, but do not lock elbows at the top.
3. **Return**: Lower the bar back to the starting position at shoulder level in a controlled manner.

### Common Mistakes
- **Arching Back**: Keep your core engaged to prevent excessive arching of the back.
- **Looking Up**: Maintain a neutral spine with your gaze forward, not upward.
- **Using Momentum**: Avoid using body motion to lift the bar; focus on muscle contraction.

### Breathing
- **Inhale**: As you lower the bar.
- **Exhale**: As you press the bar overhead.

### Tips
- Start with a light weight to master form before increasing resistance.
- Maintain a steady pace throughout the movement.
