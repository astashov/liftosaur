### Setup
1. **Position the Smith Machine**: Adjust the bar at shoulder height.
2. **Seating**: Sit on a bench with back support, ensuring your feet are flat on the floor.
3. **Grip**: Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.

### Execution
1. **Bar Position**: Start with the bar resting on the back of your shoulders and upper traps.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core for stability.
3. **Press**: Push the bar upward in a controlled manner, extending your arms fully without locking the elbows.
4. **Return**: Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, keeping it close to the back of your neck.

### Key Points
- **Posture**: Keep your back straight and avoid arching excessively.
- **Head Position**: Maintain a neutral head position; do not lift it excessively.
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the bar and exhale while pressing it upward.

### Safety Tips
- Use a spotter if lifting heavy.
- Avoid lowering the bar too far down to prevent shoulder strain.
- Ensure the knees are not buckling inward during the press.

### Common Mistakes
- Lifting the bar too far forward.
- Not engaging the core, leading to a strained back.
- Overextending the arms at the top of the movement.

Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure proper form and reduce the risk of injury while performing the Smith Machine Behind The Neck Press.
