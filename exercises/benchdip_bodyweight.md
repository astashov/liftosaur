### Setup
1. Find a stable bench, chair, or step.
2. Sit on the edge, placing your hands shoulder-width apart next to your hips.

### Execution
1. **Hand Placement**: Grip the edge of the surface with fingers facing forward.
2. **Leg Position**: Extend your legs out in front of you, keeping your heels on the floor or elevate them on another surface.
3. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Slowly bend your elbows, lowering your body toward the ground.
   - Keep your elbows close to your body at about a 45-degree angle.
   - Lower until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or slightly below, ensuring your shoulders remain down and back.
4. **Raising Phase**:
   - Press through your palms to straighten your arms, lifting your body back to the starting position.
   - Focus on engaging your triceps throughout the movement.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your back close to the bench.
- Avoid shrugging your shoulders; keep them relaxed.
- Control your movement to prevent rapid dropping or jerking motions.
- Breathe in while lowering and exhale while pushing up.

### Common Mistakes
- Flaring elbows out too wide.
- Allowing shoulders to rise or hunch.
- Not using full range of motion.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform bodyweight bench dips with proper form to target your triceps and chest.
