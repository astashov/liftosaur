### Starting Position
1. **Setup the Cable Machine**: Attach a rope or handle to a low pulley.
2. **Adjust the Weight**: Select an appropriate weight for your fitness level.
3. **Position Yourself**: Sit on the floor a few feet away from the machine, facing sideways. Grab the cable with both hands.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Sit with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, maintaining a straight back.
2. **Twist**: Pull the cable towards your body, rotating your torso. Keep your arms slightly bent. 
3. **Rotation**: Turn your upper body to one side while keeping your hips and legs stable.
4. **Return**: Slowly rotate back to the center and then to the opposite side, controlling the movement.
5. **Repetition**: Continue alternating sides with each twist.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
- Move in a controlled manner to prevent strain.
- Avoid excessive movement in your hips; the twist should come from your torso.
- Breathe steadily; exhale during the twist and inhale during the return.

### Common Mistakes
- Using momentum instead of control.
- Overextending the back or twisting from the hips.
- Not engaging the core sufficiently. 

Focus on maintaining good form to maximize effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury.
