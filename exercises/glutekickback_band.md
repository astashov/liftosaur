### Equipment Needed
- Resistance band (loop band preferred)

### Starting Position
1. **Get on all fours:** Start on your hands and knees on a mat or soft surface.
2. **Position the band:** Place the resistance band around your thighs, just above your knees.

### Execution
1. **Engage your core:** Keep your abdominal muscles tight to prevent arching your back.
2. **Position your knees:** Ensure they are hip-width apart and your hands are directly under your shoulders.
3. **Lift your leg:** Keeping your knee bent, lift one leg towards the ceiling. Ensure your foot is flexed and your heel is driving upwards.
4. **Control the movement:** Avoid arching your back as you lift; keep your back flat.
5. **Squeeze at the top:** When your thigh is parallel to the ground, pause and squeeze the glutes for a second.
6. **Lower the leg:** Slowly return your knee back to the starting position without touching the ground.

### Common Mistakes
- **Arching the back:** Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise.
- **Moving too fast:** Focus on controlled movements to maximize engagement.
- **Using momentum:** Avoid swinging your leg; keep the movement deliberate.

### Variations
- **Single band:** Use a resistance band anchored to a sturdy object for increased resistance.
- **Add ankle weights:** For an extra challenge, add ankle weights while performing the kickback.

### Tip
- Ensure your hips remain squared to the ground to effectively target the glutes.
