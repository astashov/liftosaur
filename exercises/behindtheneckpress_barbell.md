## Setup
1. **Barbell Position**: Set the barbell on a squat rack at about shoulder height.
2. **Grip**: Stand facing the bar, grip it slightly wider than shoulder-width, using a pronated grip (palms facing away).

## Execution
1. **Unrack the Bar**: Step under the bar, resting it on the upper traps/back of the shoulders.
2. **Stand Up**: Level your torso and stand straight, lifting the bar off the rack.
3. **Start Position**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart. Brace your core and keep your back straight.
4. **Press Up**: Inhale and press the bar directly upward in a controlled manner, keeping elbows slightly in front of the bar.
5. **End Position**: Extend your arms fully overhead without locking the elbows. Keep the bar straight above your body.
6. **Lower the Bar**: Exhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, controlling the descent.

## Tips
- **Wrist Position**: Keep wrists neutral and avoid excessive bending.
- **Back Alignment**: Maintain a neutral spine; avoid leaning forward or backward excessively.
- **Eye Focus**: Keep your gaze forward or slightly upward throughout the movement.
- **Bar Path**: The bar should travel in a straight line above the head without moving forward or backward.

## Safety Considerations
- Avoid using excessively heavy weights to maintain control.
- Use a spotter or safety equipment if necessary.
- People with shoulder mobility issues should consult a professional before attempting this exercise.
