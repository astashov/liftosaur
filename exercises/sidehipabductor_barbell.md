### Setup
1. **Equipment Needed**: Barbell, weight plates, and a squat rack.
2. **Starting Position**: Stand next to a squat rack. Position the barbell on one shoulder or use a landmine setup.

### Execution
1. **Foot Placement**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. The side of the body doing the work will be positioned away from the barbell.
2. **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight to stabilize your torso throughout the movement.
3. **Lift Leg**: Slowly lift the leg opposite the barbell out to the side, maintaining a slight bend in your supporting knee.
4. **Range of Motion**: Raise the leg until you feel a contraction in the hip, keeping the movement controlled.
5. **Return**: Lower the leg back to the starting position without allowing the foot to touch the ground, ensuring continuous tension on the hip muscles.

### Tips
- **Knee Position**: Ensure your knee is not locked during the movement.
- **Back Position**: Keep your back straight and avoid leaning excessively to one side.
- **Breath Control**: Inhale while lowering and exhale while lifting your leg.

### Common Mistakes
- Leaning too far to the side.
- Lifting the leg too high, which can compromise form.
- Not engaging the core properly, leading to unstable movement.

### Safety
- Start with lighter weights to avoid strain.
- Ensure the barbell is securely placed to prevent accidents.
