## Starting Position
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold a kettlebell in each hand at chest level.
3. Palms should face you (neutral grip).

## Execution
1. Engage your core and maintain a slight bend in your knees.
2. Press the kettlebells upwards in a forward motion, rotating your wrists so that palms face outward at the top.
3. At the top of the press, arms should be fully extended overhead.
4. Rotate your wrists back to the starting position (palms facing you) as you lower the kettlebells back to chest level.

## Key Points
- Keep your elbows close to your body during the movement.
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise.
- Control the movement, especially when lowering the kettlebells.

## Common Mistakes
- Arching the back excessively.
- Using momentum instead of muscle control.
- Letting elbows drift away from the body during the press.

Ensure proper form to maximize effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury.
