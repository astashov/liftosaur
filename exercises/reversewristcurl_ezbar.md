**Purpose**: Strengthens the forearm extensors.

**Starting Position**:
1. Stand or sit on a bench with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold the EZ bar with an overhand grip (palms facing down).
3. Position your forearms on your thighs or rest them on a flat surface, allowing your wrists to hang off.

**Execution**:
1. Flex your wrists upward, lifting the EZ bar. Keep your forearms stationary.
2. Squeeze at the top of the movement for a brief moment.
3. Slowly lower the EZ bar back to the starting position, controlling the movement.

**Tips**:
- Keep your elbows close to your body.
- Avoid using momentum; focus on the muscle contraction.
- Maintain a neutral spine and avoid leaning forward.

**Common Mistakes**:
- Lifting too heavy, leading to poor form.
- Allowing elbows to flare out or moving them during the curl.

**Muscles Worked**:
- Forearm extensors.
- Wrists.

**Safety**:
- Start with a lighter weight to master form before increasing.
