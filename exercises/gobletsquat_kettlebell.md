## Setup
1. **Start Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Kettlebell Grip**: Hold a kettlebell with both hands, cupping the horns (the sides of the kettlebell) close to your chest. Keep your elbows pointed down.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Squat Down**: Push your hips back while bending your knees. Keep your chest upright and elbows inside your knees.
3. **Depth**: Lower until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground or slightly below, ensuring your knees track over your toes.
4. **Maintain Form**: Keep your weight balanced on your heels and avoid rounding your back.
5. **Rise Up**: Press through your heels to stand back up, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale on the way down, exhale as you push up.
- **Head Position**: Keep your head neutral, looking forward.
- **Practice**: Start with a lighter kettlebell to master the form before increasing weight.
