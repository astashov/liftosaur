### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a pair of dumbbells.
2. **Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. **Grip**: Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing inward. Your elbows should be pointed forward.

### Execution
1. **Posture**: Keep your chest up and shoulders back, maintaining a straight back.
2. **Movement**:
   - Bend your knees while pushing your hips back.
   - Lower your body into a squat, ensuring your knees track over your toes.
   - Keep the dumbbells in place and your elbows elevated.
3. **Depth**: Go as low as you can while maintaining proper form, ideally until your thighs are parallel to the ground.
4. **Returning**: Drive through your heels to return to the starting position, keeping your chest lifted.

### Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower into the squat and exhale as you push back up.
- **Focus**: Keep your core engaged throughout the movement for stability.
- **Avoid**: Do not let your knees cave inward; ensure they remain aligned with your feet.

### Common Mistakes
