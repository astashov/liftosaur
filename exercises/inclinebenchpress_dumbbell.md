### Setup
1. **Bench Position**: Adjust the bench to an incline of about 30-45 degrees.
2. **Dumbbells**: Select a pair of dumbbells and place them on your thighs as you sit on the bench.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Sit back on the bench, and use your thighs to help lift the dumbbells to shoulder height.
2. **Grip**: Hold each dumbbell with a neutral grip (palms facing each other) or standard grip (palms facing forward).
3. **Feet Placement**: Keep your feet flat on the floor, shoulder-width apart for stability.

### Movement
1. **Press**: Inhale and lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
2. **Drive Up**: Exhale and press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended above your chest.

### Points to Remember
- Maintain a neutral spine; avoid arching your lower back.
- Keep your shoulder blades retracted and pressed against the bench.
- Control the weights throughout the movement, avoiding sudden jerks or drops.

### Safety Tips
- Ensure the weights are manageable to prevent dropping or losing control.
- If inexperienced, consider using a spotter for additional safety.
