### Assume the Starting Position
Lie on your side on a flat surface with legs extended and stacked on top of each other. Rest your head on your lower arm or place a cushion underneath for comfort.

### Engage and Lift
Keep your bottom leg grounded, engage your core, and lift the top leg upward with a straight knee. Ensure the movement comes from the hip, not the lower back or torso.

### Control the Range
Raise the leg to approximately 45 degrees or to a comfortable height without losing form or rotating the torso. Squeeze the hip abductors at the top.

### Lower Slowly
Return the leg to the starting position in a slow, controlled manner. Breathe out during the lift and in during the lowering phase. Switch sides after completing all reps.
