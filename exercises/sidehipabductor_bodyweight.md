**Starting Position:**
1. Lie on your side on a flat surface, legs extended and stacked on top of each other.
2. Rest your head on your lower arm, or place a small cushion under your head for comfort.

**Execution:**
1. Keep your legs straight and engage your core.
2. Lift the top leg upward while keeping it straight, ensuring the movement comes from the hip.
3. Avoid rotating your torso; keep the body aligned and still.
4. Raise the leg to about 45 degrees or as high as comfortable without compromising form.
5. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.
6. Slowly lower the leg back to the starting position with control.

**Points to Remember:**
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout.
- Don’t let your bottom leg move; keep it grounded.
- Focus on smooth, controlled movements.
- Breathe out during the lift and in during the lowering phase.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Allowing the torso to twist.
- Bending the knee of the top leg.
- Lifting the leg too high and losing control.

By following these steps, you can effectively perform the Bodyweight Side Hip Abductor with proper form.
