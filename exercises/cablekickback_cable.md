**Purpose:** Strengthens the glutes and targets the hamstrings.

## Setup

1. **Equipment:** Use a cable machine with an adjustable pulley.
2. **Attachment:** Attach an ankle strap to the low pulley.

## Execution

1. **Positioning:**
   - Stand facing the cable machine.
   - Attach the ankle strap to one ankle.
   - Step back slightly to create tension in the cable.

2. **Body Alignment:**
   - Keep your feet hip-width apart.
   - Hinge at the hips and slightly bend the non-working knee.
   - Maintain a straight back and engage your core.

3. **Movement:**
   - Lift the strapped leg directly behind you, keeping it straight.
   - Focus on using your glutes to lift your leg, not your lower back.
   - Hold for a brief pause at the top of the movement.

4. **Return:**
   - Slowly lower the leg back to the starting position without letting the weight stack touch.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement.

## Tips

- Avoid arching your back; keep movement smooth and controlled.
- Breathe steadily, exhaling as you lift the leg and inhaling as you lower it.
- Ensure that your standing leg remains stable during the exercise.

## Variations

- Use different angles by facing the machine in different directions.
- Adjust the cable height for additional variation in resistance.
