description: "Strengthen and isolate the glutes and hamstrings with the Cable Kickback, using an ankle strap attachment to target the posterior chain through controlled hip extension."
---

**Purpose:** Strengthens the glutes and targets the hamstrings.

## Setup

1. **Equipment:** Use a cable machine with an adjustable pulley.
2. **Attachment:** Attach an ankle strap to the low pulley.

## Execution

1. **Positioning:**
   - Stand facing the cable machine.
   - Attach the ankle strap to one ankle.
   - Step back slightly to create tension in the cable.

2. **Body Alignment:**
   - Keep your feet hip-width apart.
   - Hinge at the hips and slightly bend the non-working knee.
   - Maintain a straight back and engage your core.

3. **Movement:**
   - Lift the strapped leg directly behind you, keeping it straight.
   - Focus on using your glutes to lift your leg, not your lower back.
   - Hold for a brief pause at the top of the movement.

4. **Return:**
   - Slowly lower the leg back to the starting position without letting the weight stack touch.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement.

## Tips

- Avoid arching your back; keep movement smooth and controlled.
- Breathe steadily, exhaling as you lift the leg and inhaling as you lower it.
- Ensure that your standing leg remains stable during the exercise.

## Variations

- Use different angles by facing the machine in different directions.
- Adjust the cable height for additional variation in resistance.

### Set Up the Ankle Strap
Attach the ankle strap to the low pulley and secure it around one ankle. Stand facing the cable machine and step back slightly to create initial tension.

### Establish Your Stance
Keep feet hip-width apart, hinge slightly at the hips, and maintain a soft bend in the non-working knee. Engage your core and keep your back straight.

### Kick the Leg Back
Drive the strapped leg directly behind you in a straight line, focusing on squeezing the glutes rather than using your lower back. Pause briefly at the top.

### Lower with Control
Slowly return the leg to the starting position without allowing the weight stack to touch. Exhale as you lift and inhale as you lower.
