## Setup
1. **Position Yourself**: Sit on the leverage machine with your shoulders against the pad and your feet flat on the platform.
2. **Adjust the Pad**: Ensure the pad is resting on your hips for support and adjust the foot position for a comfortable range of motion.

## Execution
1. **Feet Placement**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart and parallel on the footplate.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your spine throughout the movement.
3. **Initiate the Thrust**: Press through your heels to lift your hips upward, squeezing your glutes at the top of the movement.
4. **Full Extension**: Aim for a straight line from your knees to your shoulders at the peak of the thrust.
5. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower your hips back down towards the starting position, maintaining tension in your glutes and hamstrings.

## Tips
- Keep your chin tucked to prevent neck strain.
- Avoid overextending your lower back; focus on using your glutes.
- Maintain a steady breathing pattern, exhaling as you thrust upward.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting too heavy, leading to poor form.
- Not engaging the core properly.
- Allowing knees to collapse inward during the movement.

By following this guide, you can effectively perform the leverage machine hip thrust with proper form to maximize glute engagement.
