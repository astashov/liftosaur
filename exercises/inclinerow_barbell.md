## Setup
1. **Incline Bench:** Set an incline bench to a 30-45 degree angle.
2. **Barbell Position:** Place a barbell on the ground in front of the bench.

## Starting Position
1. **Kneel or Stand:** Position yourself so that your chest is against the bench.
2. **Grip the Barbell:** Use an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.
3. **Feet Placement:** Keep your feet flat on the floor, spaced shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core:** Tighten your core to stabilize your body.
2. **Pull the Bar:** Inhale and pull the barbell towards your lower ribcage, keeping your elbows close to your body.
3. **Squeeze:** At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
4. **Lower Slowly:** Exhale as you lower the barbell back to the starting position, maintaining control.

## Key Points
- **Maintain Posture:** Keep your back flat and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- **Head Position:** Keep your neck neutral and align your head with your spine.
- **Controlled Movement:** Focus on smooth and controlled motions throughout the entire range of motion.

## Common Mistakes
- **Using Momentum:** Avoid swinging or jerking the weight; focus on muscle control.
- **Arching Back:** Keep your back flat to prevent strain.
- **Not Engaging Muscles:** Ensure you are fully engaging the back muscles during the lift.
