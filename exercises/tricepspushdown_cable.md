## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a rope or straight bar attachment.
2. **Adjust Height**: Set the cable pulley to a high position.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Stand facing the cable machine. Grasp the attachment with both hands, elbows close to your body, palms facing down or neutral. Feet should be shoulder-width apart.
2. **Body Position**: Keep your back straight and core engaged. Your elbows should remain stationary at your sides throughout the movement.
3. **Pushdown Phase**: Exhale and extend your arms downward, pushing the attachment down until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked.
4. **Return Phase**: Inhale and slowly allow the attachment to rise back to the starting position, maintaining control.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Elbow Position**: Keep elbows pinned to your sides; do not flare them out.
- **Wrist Alignment**: Keep wrists neutral; avoid bending them during the movement.
- **Movement Control**: Focus on a smooth motion both down and back, avoiding jerky or rapid movements.
- **Alignment**: Ensure your shoulders remain down and away from your ears throughout the exercise. 

By following these steps and tips, you can ensure an effective and safe Cable Triceps Pushdown.
