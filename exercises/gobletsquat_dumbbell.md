## Starting Position
1. **Stand Tall**: Feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Hold the Dumbbell**: Grab a dumbbell with both hands, holding it vertically close to your chest. Your elbows should point down.

## Execution
1. **Brace Your Core**: Engage your core muscles to stabilize your body.
2. **Initiate the Squat**: Push your hips back as if sitting in a chair. Keep your chest up and back straight.
3. **Lower Your Body**: Bend at your knees and hips, lowering yourself until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground.
4. **Keep the Dumbbell Steady**: Maintain the position of the dumbbell close to your chest throughout the movement.
5. **Drive Up**: Press through your heels to stand back up, extending your knees and hips fully.

## Key Points
- **Knees**: Ensure they track over your toes, not caving in.
- **Back Position**: Maintain a neutral spine; avoid rounding.
- **Movement Control**: Perform the squat in a controlled manner, avoiding fast or jerky motions.

## Common Mistakes
- Leaning too far forward.
- Allowing knees to buckle inward.
- Not maintaining an upright torso.

## Tips
- Start with a lighter weight to master form.
- Focus on breathing: inhale as you lower, exhale as you rise.
