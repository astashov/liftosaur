## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a rope attachment.
2. **Positioning**: Adjust the cable to a low position. Stand facing the machine with feet shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Grip**: Grasp the rope with both hands, palms facing each other. Your arms should be fully extended.
2. **Posture**: Stand tall with a slight bend in your knees. Engage your core and keep your back straight.
3. **Starting Position**: Pull the rope towards your face while keeping your elbows high. Your thumbs should point towards your ears.
4. **Rowing Motion**: As you pull, focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together. Keep your elbows flared out to the sides.
5. **End Position**: Bring the rope towards your face until your hands are around ear level. Hold the contraction for a moment.
6. **Return**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Exhale while pulling the rope and inhale while returning to the start.
- **Elbow Position**: Ensure that elbows stay higher than wrists throughout the exercise.
- **Avoid Momentum**: Focus on a slow, controlled movement to engage the rear deltoids effectively.

## Common Mistakes
- Pulling with the arms rather than the shoulders.
- Allowing the back to round or the torso to lean excessively.
- Ignoring the range of motion; avoid short, jerky movements.

By following these guidelines, you’ll maximize the effectiveness of the Cable Standing Row Rear Delt with Rope while minimizing the risk of injury.
