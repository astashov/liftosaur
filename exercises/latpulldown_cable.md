## Setup
1. **Seating Position**: Sit at the cable machine with your thighs under the pad. Adjust the pad so it's snug against your legs.
2. **Grip**: Reach for the bar with a wide grip, palms facing forward (overhand grip).

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Begin with your arms fully extended and back straight. Engage your core.
2. **Pull Down**: Exhale and pull the bar down towards your upper chest. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together.
3. **Elbows**: Keep your elbows pointed down and back, avoiding flaring them out to the sides.
4. **Pause**: Briefly pause at the bottom of the movement, feeling the contraction in your lats.
5. **Return**: Inhale as you slowly return the bar to the starting position, fully extending your arms without letting the weight stack touch.

## Tips
- Maintain a straight back throughout the movement to prevent strain.
- Control the weight; avoid using momentum.
- Keep your head neutral; avoid leaning back excessively.
