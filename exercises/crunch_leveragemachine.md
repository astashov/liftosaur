### Setup
1. **Adjust the Machine**: Set the seat height and back pad so that when seated, the pads rest comfortably behind your head and your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle.
2. **Select Weight**: Choose an appropriate weight that allows for controlled movement.

### Execution
1. **Position Yourself**: Sit on the machine with your back against the pad and feet resting securely on the foot platform.
2. **Grip Handles**: Hold the machine's handles for stability. Ensure your shoulders are pressed against the pad.
3. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles before starting the movement.

### Movement
1. **Start Position**: Begin with your torso upright and your arms straight.
2. **Crunch Phase**: Exhale as you curl your torso forward, bringing your elbows toward your knees. Focus on squeezing your abs.
3. **Control the Return**: Inhale as you slowly return to the starting position, keeping tension in your core throughout.

### Tips
- Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled movements.
- Keep your head neutral, avoiding excessive bending of your neck.
- Do not lock your knees; maintain a slight bend.

### Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back: Maintain a straight back during the exercise.
- Insufficient range of motion: Ensure full contraction and extension of your torso.

### Safety
- Monitor your weight selection to prevent strain.
- Ensure your movements are smooth to avoid injury.
