### Set Up and Face Away
Attach a rope to the low cable pulley. Stand facing away from the machine with feet shoulder-width apart and step far enough to create cable tension.

### Hinge and Grip
Bend at the hips and reach between your legs to grab the rope with both hands, arms extended. Keep your back straight and core engaged.

### Drive the Hips Forward
Thrust your hips forward, driving through the glutes to pull the cable through your legs. Stand tall at the top and squeeze your glutes firmly.

### Return to the Hinge
Reverse the motion by hinging at the hips and lowering back down in a controlled manner. Maintain a neutral spine throughout and avoid rounding your back.
