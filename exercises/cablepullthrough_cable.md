### Setup
1. Use a cable machine with a low pulley.
2. Attach a rope handle to the pulley. 
3. Adjust the cable to the lowest setting.
4. Stand facing away from the machine, feet shoulder-width apart.

### Execution
1. **Grip:** Bend at the hips and grab the rope with both hands, arms extended between your legs.
2. **Posture:** Keep your back straight and core engaged.
3. **Movement:** 
   - Drive your hips forward, pulling the cable through your legs.
   - Stand up tall while squeezing your glutes at the top.
4. **Return:** 
   - Reverse the motion by bending at the hips and allowing the cable to pull you back down, maintaining control.
  
### Tips
- Keep your movements smooth and controlled.
- Avoid rounding your back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Focus on squeezing your glutes throughout the movement.
