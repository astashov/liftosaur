## Setup
1. **Barbell Position**: Place the barbell on the floor close to your shins.
2. **Grip**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend at the hips and knees to grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, just outside your legs.

## Starting Position
1. **Feet**: Your feet should be flat on the ground.
2. **Back**: Keep your back straight and chest lifted. Your spine should be in a neutral position.
3. **Hips**: Shoulders should be slightly in front of the barbell.

## Execution
1. **Hinge at Hips**: Initiate the movement by hinging at your hips while maintaining a slight bend in your knees. 
2. **Lower the Bar**: Keep the barbell close to your body as you lower it down to mid-shin level or until your torso is nearly parallel to the ground.
3. **Engage Muscles**: Focus on engaging your hamstrings and glutes throughout the movement.

## Return
1. **Reverse Motion**: Drive through your heels to push your hips forward, returning to a standing position.
2. **Stand Tall**: Squeeze your glutes at the top and ensure your back remains straight.

## Common Mistakes
- **Rounding the Back**: Keep your back straight to avoid injury.
- **Letting Bar Drift**: Maintain a close grip to your body during the lift.
- **Excessive Knee Bend**: This should be a hip-dominant movement, not a squat.  

## Tips
- Start with lighter weight to master the form.
- Maintain a controlled pace for both lowering and lifting the barbell.
