### Starting Position
1. **Sit on the Ground**: Place your feet flat on the floor, knees bent.
2. **Lean Back**: Tilt your torso slightly backward, engaging your core. Keep your back straight.
3. **Hold a Dumbbell**: Grasp a dumbbell with both hands, keeping it close to your chest.

### Execution
1. **Lift Your Feet**: Raise your feet off the floor, balancing on your sit bones.
2. **Twist Your Torso**: Rotate your torso to the right, bringing the dumbbell towards the floor beside your hip. Keep your arms straight, but do not lock your elbows.
3. **Return to Center**: Bring the dumbbell back to the center while maintaining a strong core.
4. **Twist to the Left**: Rotate your torso to the left, lowering the dumbbell towards your left hip.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Engage Core**: Keep your abdominal muscles engaged throughout the movement.
- **Control the Movement**: Avoid rapid or jerky motions; focus on a controlled twist.
- **Breathing**: Exhale when twisting and inhale when returning to the center.
- **Spine Position**: Maintain a neutral spine; avoid rounding your back.

### Common Mistakes
- **Arching the Back**: Keep your back straight to prevent strain.
- **Inadequate Core Engagement**: Focus on engaging your core to stabilize your body.
- **Lifting Feet Too High**: Keep your feet at a height where you feel balanced.

### Variations
- **Leg Position**: Keep feet on the ground for more stability or extend legs for added challenge.
