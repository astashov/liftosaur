### Equipment Needed
- Cable machine with ankle attachment or a low pulley
- Hanging leg raise attachment (optional for added grip)

### Starting Position
1. Adjust the cable machine to a low setting and attach the ankle strap.
2. Position yourself facing the cable machine.
3. Secure the ankle strap around your ankles, ensuring it’s snug.

### Execution
1. **Initiate the Movement**: Grasp a stable surface for support (e.g., the cable machine or a pull-up bar if using a different setup).
2. **Hang with Control**: Let your body hang freely with legs straight down and engage your core muscles.
3. **Lift Your Legs**: Bend at the hips and lift your legs upwards while keeping them straight. Aim for your legs to be parallel to the floor or higher without rounding your back.
4. **Hold**: Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, focusing on squeezing your core.
5. **Lower with Control**: Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your core tight during the entire movement to prevent swinging.
- Avoid using momentum; focus on the muscle engagement.
- Maintain a neutral spine; do not arch your back excessively.
- Perform the movement in a slow and controlled manner to maximize effectiveness.

### Common Mistakes
- Swinging legs instead of lifting them with control.
- Arching the back; ensure to keep the core engaged.
- Allowing the knees to bend excessively.

By following these guidelines, you will effectively and safely perform the Cable Hanging Leg Raise to strengthen your core.
