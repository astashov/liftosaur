## Equipment Needed
- Resistance band

## Setup
1. **Anchor the Band:** Secure the resistance band at a low point behind you, ensuring it won't move.
2. **Grip the Band:** Stand facing away from the anchor point, holding the band with both hands, shoulder-width apart.

## Starting Position
1. **Elbows Bent:** Raise your arms, bending your elbows at about a 90-degree angle so the band rests across your upper back and shoulders.
2. **Feet Shoulder-width:** Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Press Up:** Press the band overhead until your arms are fully extended.
2. **Control Descent:** Lower the band back to the starting position with control, keeping your elbows slightly below shoulder height.

## Key Points
- **Engage Core:** Keep your core engaged to maintain stability.
- **Avoid Leaning:** Do not lean forward or arch your back; stay upright throughout the movement.
- **Breath:** Exhale while pressing up and inhale while lowering.

## Safety Tips
- Ensure the band is secure and of appropriate resistance to avoid injury.
- Avoid excessive strain on the shoulders; if discomfort occurs, stop the exercise.
