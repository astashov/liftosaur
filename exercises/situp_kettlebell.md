## Starting Position
1. **Lie on Your Back**: Start on a flat surface with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. **Kettlebell Placement**: Hold a kettlebell with both hands, positioned above your chest. Elbows should be slightly bent.

## Execution
1. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your body.
2. **Press Kettlebell Up**: Extend your arms straight up towards the ceiling.
3. **Sit Up**: Use your core to lift your upper body towards your knees, keeping the kettlebell directly above your chest throughout the movement.
4. **Controlled Descent**: Lower back down slowly, maintaining control as your back hits the ground.

## Key Form Tips
- **Keep the Core Tight**: Focus on using your abdominal muscles rather than your neck or back.
- **Avoid Overextending**: Don't push your head forward; keep a neutral spine.
- **Breathe**: Exhale on the way up, inhale on the way down.

## Common Mistakes
- **Lifting with the Neck/Back**: Ensure you initiate the movement from your core.
- **Kettlebell Position**: Keep it stable above your chest to avoid strain. 

By following these steps, you can perform kettlebell sit-ups safely and effectively.
