## Setup
1. **Starting Position**: Stand upright with feet shoulder-width apart, arms relaxed at your sides.

## Execution
2. **Lift Arms**: Raise your arms straight in front of you to shoulder height, keeping a slight bend in the elbows. Palms should face down.
3. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core and maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
4. **Hold and Control**: Pause at the top of the movement for a moment, then slowly lower your arms back to the starting position.

## Tips
- **Avoid Momentum**: Move slowly and steadily; avoid swinging your arms.
- **Shoulder Alignment**: Keep shoulders relaxed, away from ears.
- **Breathing**: Inhale while raising arms and exhale while lowering them.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting too high (beyond shoulder height).
- Using excessive body movement (e.g., leaning back).
- Tension in the neck or shoulders.

## Benefits
- Strengthens shoulder muscles.
- Improves shoulder stability and mobility.
