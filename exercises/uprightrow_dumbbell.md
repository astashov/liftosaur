### Starting Position
1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip (palms facing you).
3. Let the dumbbells hang at arm's length in front of your thighs.

#### Execution
1. **Lift the Weights**: Pull the dumbbells straight up towards your chin, keeping them close to your body.
2. **Elbow Position**: Lead with your elbows; they should rise higher than your wrists. Keep the elbows out to the sides.
3. **Neutral Spine**: Maintain a straight back and avoid leaning back as you lift.
4. **Shoulder Engagement**: Focus on using your shoulders and upper traps to lift the weights.

#### Top Position
1. At the top of the movement, your elbows should be at shoulder height or slightly above.
2. Hold for a moment, ensuring your shoulders are engaged without shrugging excessively.

#### Lowering the Weights
1. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
2. Avoid swinging; maintain tension in your muscles throughout the descent.

#### Tips
- Keep your core tight to stabilize your body.
- Use a weight that allows for controlled movement without excessive strain.
- Avoid jerking or using momentum to lift the weights.

#### Common Mistakes
- Raising the dumbbells too high or shrugging the shoulders.
- Allowing the wrists to bend excessively.
- Using too much weight, which can lead to improper form.
