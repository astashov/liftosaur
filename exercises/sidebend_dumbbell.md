---

**Starting Position:**
1. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold a dumbbell in one hand, allowing it to hang at your side.
3. Place your opposite hand on your hip or allow it to hang naturally.

**Movement:**
1. Keep your core engaged to stabilize your torso.
2. Slowly lean to the side where you are holding the dumbbell, bending at the waist.
3. Lower the dumbbell toward the knee while keeping your back straight.
4. Stop when you feel a stretch in your oblique muscles, ensuring not to twist your torso.
5. Return to the starting position by contracting your obliques to pull yourself back upright.

**Tips:**
- Perform the movement in a controlled manner to avoid momentum.
- Keep your head aligned with your spine throughout the exercise.
- Avoid leaning forward or backward; maintain a straight line from your head to your hips.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Overextending the movement beyond a comfortable range.
- Twisting the torso instead of bending sideways.
- Holding your breath; remember to breathe steadily.

**Variations:**
- Perform the exercise seated for more stability.
- Use a lighter weight to focus on form if you're new to the exercise.
