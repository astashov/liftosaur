### Starting Position:
1. Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
2. Extend one leg straight up toward the ceiling while keeping the other bent.

### Execution:
1. **Engage the Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your pelvis.
2. **Lift the Hips**: Push through the heel of the bent leg to raise your hips off the ground.
3. **Alignment**: Ensure your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your extended leg.
4. **Hold the Position**: Squeeze your glutes at the top and hold for a moment.
5. **Lower Down**: Slowly return to the starting position by lowering your hips back to the ground.

### Tips:
- Keep your shoulders on the floor throughout the movement.
- Avoid arching your back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Focus on using your glutes to lift, not your lower back or hamstrings.
- Alternate legs after completing the desired number of repetitions.
