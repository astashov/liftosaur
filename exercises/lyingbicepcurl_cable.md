## Setup
1. **Cable Machine**: Attach a straight bar or rope handle to the low pulley of a cable machine.
2. **Bench Position**: Position a flat bench parallel to the cable machine, ensuring easy access to the handle.

## Execution
1. **Lie Down**: Lay on your back on the bench with your head closest to the cable machine.
2. **Grip**: Reach for the handle and grasp it with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
3. **Arm Position**: Extend your arms fully, keeping your elbows close to your torso and resting against the bench.
4. **Curl Movement**: Engage your biceps and curl the handle towards your shoulders. 
5. **Controlled Motion**: Keep your elbows stationary; only your forearms should move.
6. **Peak Contraction**: Squeeze the biceps at the top of the movement for a second.
7. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower the handle back to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking your elbows.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise.
- Avoid swinging your body; keep the movement controlled.
- Adjust the cable’s height and weight according to your comfort and strength level. 

## Safety
- Ensure the cable is securely attached before beginning.
- Start with a lighter weight to master the form before increasing resistance.
