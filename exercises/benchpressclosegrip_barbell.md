### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a standard flat bench and a barbell.
2. **Positioning**: Lie flat on the bench with your back supported and feet firmly on the ground. Ensure your body is centered.
3. **Grip**: Grasp the barbell with a close grip (about shoulder-width apart) using an overhand grip (palms facing away).

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Lift the barbell off the rack with extended arms, keeping it directly above your chest.
2. **Lowering the Bar**: Inhale and lower the bar slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in closer to your body (approximately a 45-degree angle).
3. **Depth**: Lower the bar until it lightly touches your chest.
4. **Pressing**: Exhale and push the barbell back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking the elbows.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight to maintain stability.
- **Foot Position**: Keep your feet flat on the ground to avoid lifting your hips.
- **Controlled Movement**: Perform the movement in a controlled manner, avoiding bouncing the bar off your chest.
- **Spotter**: Use a spotter if lifting heavy to ensure safety.

### Key Points
- Maintain a neutral wrist position.
- Keep your head, shoulders, and buttocks on the bench throughout the movement.
- Focus on triceps engagement for effective results.
