### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a standard flat bench and a barbell.
2. **Positioning**: Lie flat on the bench with your back supported and feet firmly on the ground. Ensure your body is centered.
3. **Grip**: Grasp the barbell with a close grip (about shoulder-width apart) using an overhand grip (palms facing away).

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Lift the barbell off the rack with extended arms, keeping it directly above your chest.
2. **Lowering the Bar**: Inhale and lower the bar slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in closer to your body (approximately a 45-degree angle).
3. **Depth**: Lower the bar until it lightly touches your chest.
4. **Pressing**: Exhale and push the barbell back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking the elbows.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight to maintain stability.
- **Foot Position**: Keep your feet flat on the ground to avoid lifting your hips.
- **Controlled Movement**: Perform the movement in a controlled manner, avoiding bouncing the bar off your chest.
- **Spotter**: Use a spotter if lifting heavy to ensure safety.

### Key Points
- Maintain a neutral wrist position.
- Keep your head, shoulders, and buttocks on the bench throughout the movement.
- Focus on triceps engagement for effective results.

### Set Your Grip
Lie on the bench and grip the barbell at shoulder-width with an overhand grip. This narrower-than-usual grip shifts the emphasis onto the triceps.

### Unrack and Position
Lift the bar off the rack and hold it directly above your chest with arms extended. Keep your core tight and feet flat on the ground.

### Lower with Elbows Tucked
Inhale and slowly lower the bar to your chest, keeping elbows tucked at about 45 degrees to your body. Lower until the bar lightly touches your chest.

### Press Back Up
Exhale and push the bar back to the starting position without locking the elbows. Maintain a neutral wrist position and keep all body contact points on the bench.
