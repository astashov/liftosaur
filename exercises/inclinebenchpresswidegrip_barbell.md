## Equipment Needed
- Barbell 
- Adjustable incline bench 
- Weight plates

## Setup
1. **Bench Position**: Set the bench to a 30-45 degree incline.
2. **Grip**: Lie on the bench with your back flat. Grip the barbell wider than shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Position the barbell above your chest, arms fully extended. Your wrists should be aligned with your elbows.
2. **Lowering the Bar**: Inhale as you lower the bar to your upper chest. Keep elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body.
3. **Pressing Up**: Exhale and push the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking elbows.

## Form Tips
- **Feet**: Keep your feet flat on the ground for stability.
- **Back**: Maintain a neutral spine; do not arch excessively.
- **Control**: Perform the movement slowly and with control; avoid bouncing the bar off your chest.
- **Head Position**: Keep your head pressed against the bench.

## Safety
- Use a spotter if lifting heavy.
- Ensure weights are secured on the barbell. 

Follow these steps for effective workout results while minimizing injury risk.
