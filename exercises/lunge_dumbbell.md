## Starting Position
- Stand upright with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides.
- Feet should be shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Step Forward**: Take a step forward with your right foot, maintaining a straight torso.
2. **Lower Body**: Bend both knees to lower your body. The back knee should hover just above the ground, and the front knee should remain aligned over the ankle.
3. **Push Back**: Push through the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position.
4. **Repeat**: Alternate legs for the next repetition.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.
- Maintain an upright torso; avoid leaning forward.
- Ensure your front knee does not extend past your toes to prevent injury.
- Control your movement; avoid rushing through the exercise. 

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the front knee to cave inward.
- Leaning forward excessively.
- Not stepping far enough forward, limiting the range of motion.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can perform the Dumbbell Lunge effectively and safely.
