**Starting Position:**
1. Stand upright with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Keep your knees straight but not locked.
3. Position your toes pointing forward or slightly outward.
4. Engage your core for stability.

**Execution:**
1. Slowly rise onto the balls of your feet, lifting your heels off the ground.
2. Keep your movements controlled; do not bounce.
3. Hold the top position briefly, feeling the contraction in your calves.
4. Lower your heels back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.

**Form Tips:**
- Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels.
- Avoid leaning forward or backward; keep your weight balanced over your feet.
- Focus on isolating the calf muscles during the lift.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Performing the exercise too quickly.
- Using momentum rather than muscle strength.
- Not fully extending or lowering the heels.

**Variations:**
- Perform on an elevated surface for a greater range of motion.
- Try single-leg calf raises for added difficulty.
