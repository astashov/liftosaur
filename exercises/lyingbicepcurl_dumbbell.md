### Instructions:

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Lie flat on a bench, face up, with a dumbbell in each hand.
   - Keep your arms fully extended and palms facing upward.

2. **Body Alignment**:
   - Ensure your back is pressed against the bench.
   - Keep your legs flat on the ground with your feet shoulder-width apart.

3. **Curl Movement**:
   - Slowly bend your elbows to lift the dumbbells towards your shoulders.
   - Focus on using your biceps to lift the weights, maintaining control throughout the movement.

4. **Top Position**:
   - At the peak, squeeze your biceps for a brief moment.
   - Ensure your upper arms remain stationary; only your forearms should move.

5. **Lowering the Weight**:
   - Gently lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
   - Control the motion to avoid momentum and reduce risk of injury.

6. **Breathing**:
   - Inhale as you lower the weights and exhale as you lift them.

### Tips for Proper Form:
- Keep your elbows close to your torso throughout the exercise.
- Avoid swinging or using your back for momentum.
- Choose a weight that allows you to maintain control without compromising form. 

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Lifting too heavily, leading to poor form.
- Arching the back or lifting your shoulders off the bench.
- Allowing elbows to flare out to the sides. 

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Dumbbell Lying Bicep Curl effectively and safely.
