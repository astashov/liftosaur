   - Focus on using your biceps to lift the weights, maintaining control throughout the movement.

4. **Top Position**:
   - At the peak, squeeze your biceps for a brief moment.
   - Ensure your upper arms remain stationary; only your forearms should move.

5. **Lowering the Weight**:
   - Gently lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
   - Control the motion to avoid momentum and reduce risk of injury.

6. **Breathing**:
