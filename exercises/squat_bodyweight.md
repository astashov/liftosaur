### Starting Position
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Toes should point slightly outward.

### Execution
1. Engage your core.
2. Initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously.
3. Keep your chest up and back straight throughout the movement.
4. Lower your body as if sitting back into a chair, ensuring knees stay aligned with toes (not extending past them).
5. Go down until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground, or lower if comfortable.
6. Press through your heels to return to the starting position, straightening your legs.

### Key Points
- Maintain a neutral spine and avoid rounding your back.
- Keep your weight centered over your feet.
- Look forward, not down, to help maintain posture.
- Breath in while lowering, and exhale while rising.

### Common Mistakes
- Allowing knees to cave inward.
- Lifting heels off the ground.
- Rounding the back or leaning too far forward. 

By following these guidelines, you can perform bodyweight squats effectively and safely.
