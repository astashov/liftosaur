## Setup
1. **Equipment Needed**: Barbell (EZ bar recommended), weight plates, bench.
2. **Positioning**: Lie on a flat bench with your head at one end, feet flat on the ground.

## Grip
1. **Hand Placement**: Grip the barbell with a narrow grip (shoulder-width or slightly narrower).
2. **Starting Position**: Extend your arms fully, holding the barbell above your chest with elbows slightly bent.

## Execution
1. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows.
   - Lower the barbell towards your forehead or just behind it. Maintain control without letting your elbows flare out.
   
2. **Lifting Phase**:
   - Exhale as you extend your arms back to the starting position.
   - Focus on engaging your triceps during the upward movement.

## Key Points
- Keep your upper arms stationary; only your forearms should move.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position to avoid strain.
- Avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement to keep tension on the triceps.
- Ensure back and head remain in contact with the bench throughout the exercise.

## Common Mistakes
- Flaring elbows: Keep them tucked in to protect shoulder joints.
- Using momentum: Focus on controlled movements rather than speed.

## Conclusion
Perform the Barbell Skullcrusher with strict form to target the triceps effectively and prevent injury.
