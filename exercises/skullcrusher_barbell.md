## Setup
1. **Equipment Needed**: Barbell (EZ bar recommended), weight plates, bench.
2. **Positioning**: Lie on a flat bench with your head at one end, feet flat on the ground.

## Grip
1. **Hand Placement**: Grip the barbell with a narrow grip (shoulder-width or slightly narrower).
2. **Starting Position**: Extend your arms fully, holding the barbell above your chest with elbows slightly bent.

## Execution
1. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows.
   - Lower the barbell towards your forehead or just behind it. Maintain control without letting your elbows flare out.
   
2. **Lifting Phase**:
   - Exhale as you extend your arms back to the starting position.
   - Focus on engaging your triceps during the upward movement.

## Key Points
- Keep your upper arms stationary; only your forearms should move.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position to avoid strain.
- Avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement to keep tension on the triceps.
- Ensure back and head remain in contact with the bench throughout the exercise.

## Common Mistakes
- Flaring elbows: Keep them tucked in to protect shoulder joints.
- Using momentum: Focus on controlled movements rather than speed.

## Conclusion
Perform the Barbell Skullcrusher with strict form to target the triceps effectively and prevent injury.

### Set Up on the Bench
Lie on a flat bench with your head at one end and feet flat on the ground. Grip the barbell with a narrow overhand grip and extend your arms fully above your chest.

### Lower Toward the Forehead
Inhale and slowly bend your elbows to lower the barbell toward your forehead or just behind it. Keep your upper arms stationary and elbows from flaring outward.

### Extend Back to Start
Exhale and press the bar back to the starting position by extending your elbows, focusing on engaging the triceps. Avoid locking out your elbows at the top to maintain tension.

### Maintain Form Throughout
Keep your back and head in contact with the bench for the entire set. Use a neutral wrist position and prioritize controlled movement over heavy load.
