### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and place it on the floor in front of you.
2. **Stance**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your shins close to the barbell.

### Grip
1. **Grip the Bar**: Bend at the hips and knees to lower your torso.
2. **Hand Position**: Use an overhand grip, approximately shoulder-width apart.

### Positioning
1. **Back Angle**: Keep your back flat and parallel to the floor.
2. **Hips**: Your hips should be slightly higher than your knees, creating a stable base.

### Execution
1. **Lift the Bar**: Engage your back and pull the barbell towards your lower chest or upper abdomen.
2. **Elbow Path**: Keep elbows close to your body as you row.
3. **Upper Body**: Maintain the flat back position throughout the movement.

### Return
1. **Controlled Descent**: Lower the barbell back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
2. **Core Engagement**: Keep your core tight to maintain stability.

### Key Points
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the bar, exhale as you lift.
- **Avoid Momentum**: Do not use momentum; focus on muscle engagement.
- **Alignment**: Ensure your neck stays neutral; avoid looking up or excessively hunching forward.

By following these steps, you can perform the Barbell Pendlay Row with proper form to effectively target your back muscles.
