2. **Movement:**
   - Slowly lower your heels towards the ground while maintaining control.
   - Go down until you feel a stretch in your calves but do not let your heels touch the ground.

3. **Peak Contraction:**
   - Lift your heels up as high as you can, squeezing your calves at the top of the movement.

4. **Repetition:**
   - Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Maintain a straight back against the pad throughout the movement.
