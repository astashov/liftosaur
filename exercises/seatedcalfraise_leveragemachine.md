## Setup
1. **Adjust the Machine:** 
   - Set the foot platform so that your knees are bent at a comfortable angle.
   - Adjust the backrest for proper support.

2. **Position Yourself:**
   - Sit on the machine with your back against the pad.
   - Place your feet on the foot platform, positioning the balls of your feet at the edge.

3. **Foot Placement:**
   - Your heels should hang off the back of the platform, allowing for a full range of motion during the exercise.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Press the weight down using your toes (balls of your feet) while lifting your heels as high as possible. This is your starting position.

2. **Movement:**
   - Slowly lower your heels towards the ground while maintaining control.
   - Go down until you feel a stretch in your calves but do not let your heels touch the ground.

3. **Peak Contraction:**
   - Lift your heels up as high as you can, squeezing your calves at the top of the movement.

4. **Repetition:**
   - Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Maintain a straight back against the pad throughout the movement.
- Avoid bouncing at the bottom to ensure muscle engagement and prevent injury.
- Focus on a smooth and controlled motion, both upward and downward.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the leverage machine seated calf raise effectively while minimizing the risk of injury.
