## Setup
1. **Position Yourself**: Sit on the leverage machine with your back against the pad. Adjust the seat height if needed.
2. **Grip Handles**: Grasp the handles firmly with your palms facing down.

## Execution
1. **Feet Placement**: Keep your feet flat on the ground, positioned shoulder-width apart.
2. **Start Position**: Push down on the handles so your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.
3. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows while maintaining control. Keep your elbows close to your torso.
4. **Depth Control**: Lower to a comfortable depth while keeping tension in your triceps. Avoid going too low to prevent shoulder strain.
5. **Press Up**: Press through your palms to straighten your arms, returning to the start position. Focus on using your triceps for the lift.

## Key Points
- Maintain a straight back and engaged core throughout the movement.
- Avoid flaring out your elbows; keep them tucked in.
- Control both the lowering and lifting phases to maximize effectiveness and prevent injury.
