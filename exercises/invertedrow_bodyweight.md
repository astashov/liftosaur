## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a sturdy bar, suspension trainer, or a low-hanging horizontal surface.
2. **Body Position**: Lie underneath the bar, facing up, with your body straight, heels on the ground, and arms extended to grasp the bar, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Grip**: Grasp the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing away).
2. **Body Alignment**: Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, engaging your core and glutes.
3. **Pulling Motion**: Exhale as you pull your chest toward the bar by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body.
4. **Hold**: Pause briefly at the top of the movement (chest near the bar).
5. **Return**: Inhale as you lower your body back to the starting position, fully extending your arms while maintaining body alignment.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears.
- Avoid arching your back; maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Adjust your height or body angle to modify the difficulty.

## Common Mistakes
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.
- Letting hips sag or rising too high.
- Not keeping elbows close to the body.

## Progression
- Elevate your feet for increased difficulty.
- Use a wider grip to target different muscle groups.
