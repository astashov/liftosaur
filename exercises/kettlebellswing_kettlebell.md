## Starting Position
1. **Feet Placement**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip the Kettlebell**: Bend slightly at your knees, hinge at your hips, and grasp the kettlebell with both hands, palms facing you.

## Execution
1. **Hinge at the Hips**: Push your hips back while keeping your back straight, allowing the kettlebell to swing between your legs.
2. **Engage the Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your torso.
3. **Swing Up**: Drive through your heels, thrust your hips forward, and swing the kettlebell up to shoulder height. 
4. **Use Arms Sparingly**: Let the momentum carry the kettlebell; your arms should be relaxed, guiding rather than lifting.
5. **Controlled Descent**: Allow the kettlebell to swing back down between your legs, maintaining a hip hinge and a flat back.

## Key Points
- **Posture**: Keep your back neutral and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- **Breathing**: Exhale on the upward swing, inhale as the kettlebell descends.
- **Knees**: Don't let your knees go beyond your toes during the swing.

## Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back.
- Overextending the arms.
- Using the upper body instead of the hips to drive the movement.

## Safety Tips
- Start with a lighter kettlebell to master the form.
- Ensure enough space around you to avoid hitting anything during the swing. 

Using these guidelines will help you perform the kettlebell swing effectively and safely.
