### Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Sit on the machine and adjust the seat height so your knees are comfortably secured under the thigh pads.
2. **Grip the Handles**: Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

### Execution
1. **Start Position**: Sit upright with your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and arms fully extended upwards.
2. **Pull Down**: Engage your back muscles and pull the handles down towards your chest, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together.
3. **Elbow Position**: Keep your elbows close to your body throughout the movement.
4. **Pause**: Hold the contraction at the bottom for a moment, feeling the tension in your lats.
5. **Return**: Slowly raise the handles back to the starting position, fully extending your arms while maintaining control of the weight.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral and straight back during the movement.
- Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled movements.
- Breathe out as you pull the handles down and inhale while returning to the start.
