### Starting Position
1. **Stand Tall**: Feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent.
2. **Grip**: Hold a barbell with both hands, palms facing down, and arms extended in front of your thighs.

### Execution
1. **Raise the Barbell**: Lift the barbell in front of you to shoulder height while keeping your arms straight. 
2. **Elbow Position**: Ensure your elbows remain slightly bent throughout the movement.
3. **Controlled Movement**: Lift the barbell in a steady motion; avoid swinging or using momentum.
4. **Pause at the Top**: Hold the position briefly at shoulder height.

### Lowering the Barbell
1. **Return Slowly**: Lower the barbell back to the starting position, maintaining control and avoiding sudden drops.

### Key Points
- **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight to maintain stability.
- **Avoid Overextending**: Do not raise the barbell above shoulder height to prevent shoulder strain.
- **Neutral Neck**: Keep your neck in a neutral position; don’t lean back excessively.
- **Breathe**: Exhale while raising the barbell and inhale while lowering it.

### Safety Tips
- Start with a lighter weight to master form before increasing weight.
- If any discomfort occurs in the shoulders, stop the exercise.
