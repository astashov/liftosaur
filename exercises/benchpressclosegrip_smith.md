## Setup
1. **Machine Adjustment**: Adjust the bench to ensure your body is flat and your feet are shoulder-width apart on the floor.
2. **Bar Position**: Position the Smith machine bar at a height that allows you to easily reach it when lying on the bench.

## Grip
1. **Hand Placement**: Use a close grip, placing your hands slightly inside shoulder-width. The palms should face forward.
2. **Wrist Position**: Keep your wrists straight and firmly grip the bar.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Lie back on the bench with your eyes directly beneath the bar. Unrack the bar by straightening your arms.
2. **Lowering the Bar**: Inhale and slowly lower the bar toward your lower chest, keeping your elbows close to your body. Your forearms should remain vertical.
3. **Pressing the Bar**: Exhale and push the bar back up to the starting position, locking your arms at the top without overextending.

## Tips
- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.
- Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest; control the movement.
- Maintain a stable back; do not arch excessively.

## Common Mistakes
- Gripping the bar too wide.
- Letting elbows flare out excessively.
- Not using a controlled tempo.

## Safety Considerations
- Use a spotter if you're lifting heavy.
- Ensure the bar is secured to prevent it from moving unexpectedly.
