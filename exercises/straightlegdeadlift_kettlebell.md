### Starting Position
1. **Stand Tall**: Begin by standing with feet hip-width apart and the kettlebell between your feet.
2. **Grip the Kettlebell**: Bend at the hips and slightly bend your knees to reach down and grab the kettlebell with both hands, palms facing you.

#### Execution
1. **Engage Your Core**: Brace your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Hinge at the Hips**: Push your hips back, lowering your torso while keeping your back straight. Your knees should remain slightly bent throughout.
3. **Lower the Kettlebell**: Let the kettlebell slide down your legs as you maintain a neutral spine. Go as low as your flexibility allows without compromising form.
4. **Return to Starting Position**: Drive through your heels, push your hips forward, and stand upright, lifting the kettlebell back to the starting position.

#### Key Form Tips
- Keep your shoulders back and down, away from your ears.
- Maintain a straight back, avoiding rounding your spine at any point.
- Focus on hinging at the hips rather than bending at the waist.
- Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.

#### Breathing
- Inhale while lowering the kettlebell.
- Exhale as you stand up to the starting position.
