## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and a flat bench.
2. **Position**: Lie flat on your back on the bench, feet firmly planted on the ground.

## Grip
1. **Hand Position**: Grip the barbell with both hands, shoulder-width apart or slightly narrower.
2. **Grip Type**: Use an overhand grip (palms facing away from you).

## Movement
1. **Starting Position**: Extend your arms straight up above your chest, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
2. **Lowering the Barbell**: Bend at the elbows to lower the barbell slowly towards your forehead, keeping your upper arms stationary.
3. **Elbow Position**: Ensure elbows remain tucked in and do not flare out.

## Extension
1. **Return to Starting Position**: Push through with your triceps to extend your arms back to the starting position.
2. **Control**: Maintain a controlled motion throughout the exercise; avoid using momentum.

## Tips
- Keep your core engaged for stability.
- Avoid arching your back; keep it pressed against the bench.
- Focus on using your triceps to control the weight.

## Safety
- Start with a lighter weight to ensure form is correct before increasing load.
- Use a spotter if lifting heavy. 

Remember to maintain proper form to maximize effectiveness and minimize injury risk.
