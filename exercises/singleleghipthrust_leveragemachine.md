## Setup
1. **Position the Machine**: Adjust the lever of the machine to an appropriate height for your legs.
2. **Sit Down**: Sit on the machine with your back against the pad.
3. **Foot Placement**: Place one foot on the footplate and the other foot off the machine, ideally resting on a platform or the floor.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Keep your working leg bent at a 90-degree angle. Your other leg should be extended or bent at an angle off the machine.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your body throughout the movement.
3. **Drive Through Heel**: Push through the heel of the foot on the footplate to lift your hips. Keep your knee aligned with your toes.
4. **Lift Hips**: Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knee.
5. **Squeeze Glutes**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your glutes for maximum contraction.
6. **Lower Back Down**: Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position without losing control.

## Tips
- Focus on using your glutes rather than your hamstrings or lower back.
- Keep the movement slow and controlled to maximize muscle engagement.
- Ensure that your knee does not cave inward during the lift.

## Safety
- Avoid arching your back excessively; maintain a neutral spine.
- Start with lighter resistance to master the form before increasing weight.
