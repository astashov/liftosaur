### Starting Position
1. Lie on your back on a mat.
2. Bend your knees at a 90-degree angle, feet flat on the floor.
3. Place your hands behind your head or cross them over your chest.

### Execution
1. Engage your core by tightening your abdominal muscles.
2. Slowly lift your upper body towards your knees, using your core for support.
3. Keep your feet and lower back on the ground as you curl up.
4. Go as high as you can without straining your neck or back.
5. Pause briefly at the top of the movement.

### Lowering Down
1. Slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position, maintaining control.
2. Do not let your lower back arch excessively; keep it in contact with the mat.

### Tips
- Avoid pulling on your neck with your hands.
- Keep your chin slightly tucked throughout the movement.
- Focus on using your abdominal muscles rather than momentum.
