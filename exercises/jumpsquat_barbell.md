### Setup
1. **Barbell Placement**: Position the barbell on your upper back, resting on your traps. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip**: Use an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Stand tall with your chest up and core engaged.
2. **Descent**: Lower into a squat by bending your knees and hips, keeping your back straight and eyes forward. Lower until thighs are parallel to the ground.
3. **Jump**: Explode upward by pushing through your heels, extending your knees and hips. 
4. **Airborne**: Keep your knees slightly bent as you leave the ground. Aim to gain height with the jump.
5. **Landing**: Land softly back into the squat position, absorbing the impact by bending your knees and hips.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Ensure your knees do not cave inward during the squat.
- Focus on explosive power without compromising form.

### Safety
- Start with lighter weights to master the technique before increasing the load.
- Perform on a stable surface to minimize injury risk.
