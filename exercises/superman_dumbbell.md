### Starting Position
1. Lie face down on a mat with arms extended in front of you, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Keep your legs straight and together, toes pointed.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Lift Upper Body**: Raise your arms, chest, and head off the ground. Focus on lifting through the shoulders.
3. **Lift Lower Body**: Simultaneously, lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight.
4. **Hold Position**: At the top of the movement, your body should form a straight line from fingertips to toes.
5. **Lower Down**: Slowly lower your arms and legs back to the starting position.

### Tips
- Keep your neck in a neutral position, avoiding strain.
- Focus on the contraction of your back and glutes during the lift.
- Avoid overarching your lower back; engage your core throughout the movement. 

### Breathing
- Inhale as you prepare, exhale while lifting, and inhale again as you lower.
