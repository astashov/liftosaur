## Starting Position
- Stand upright with feet shoulder-width apart.
- Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides with palms facing inward.
- Keep your core engaged and maintain a straight posture.

## Movement
1. **Raise Dumbbells**: Slowly lift the dumbbells out to the sides. 
2. **Elbow Position**: Keep a slight bend in the elbows throughout the movement.
3. **Humerus Parallel**: Raise the dumbbells until your arms are parallel to the floor, or slightly below shoulder level.
4. **Control the Descent**: Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner.

## Tips
- **Avoid Swinging**: Do not use momentum to lift the weights; focus on the muscle movement.
- **Engage Shoulders**: Concentrate on squeezing your shoulder muscles during the lift.
- **Breathing**: Exhale as you lift the weights and inhale as you lower them.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting weights too high (beyond shoulder height).
- Allowing the back to lean or sway.
- Using weights that are too heavy, compromising form. 

## Safety Precautions
- Start with lighter weights to ensure proper form before progressing.
- Stop if you feel any pain or discomfort in the shoulders or neck. 

Following these guidelines will help you perform the Dumbbell Lateral Raise effectively and safely.
