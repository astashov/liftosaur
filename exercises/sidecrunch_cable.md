description: "Build oblique strength with the Cable Side Crunch, bending the torso laterally against cable resistance to isolate and fatigue the side core muscles."
---

**Setup:**
1. Attach a single handle to the low pulley on a cable machine.
2. Stand perpendicular to the machine, grasping the handle with the hand closest to the machine.

**Execution:**
1. Position your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent.
2. Pull the cable handle over your shoulder, keeping your arm extended but not locked.
3. Brace your core and tilt your torso away from the machine.
4. Initiate the crunch by bending your torso to the side, bringing your elbow towards your hip.
5. Contract your obliques at the bottom of the movement, ensuring your motion is controlled.
6. Slowly return to the starting position, maintaining tension in your core.

**Tips:**
- Focus on using your obliques rather than momentum.
- Keep movements smooth and deliberate.
- Ensure your hips remain stable throughout the exercise.

### Attach and Position
Attach a single handle to a low cable pulley. Stand perpendicular to the machine and grip the handle with the closest hand, feet shoulder-width apart.

### Set the Start Position
Pull the cable handle over your shoulder with arm extended. Brace your core and tilt your torso slightly away from the machine to load the obliques.

### Crunch Laterally
Bend your torso sideways toward the machine, bringing your elbow toward your hip. Contract the obliques firmly at the bottom of the movement.

### Return Under Control
Slowly return to the starting position while maintaining tension in your core. Keep movements smooth and avoid jerky or momentum-driven motion.
