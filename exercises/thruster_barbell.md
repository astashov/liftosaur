## Setup
1. **Barbell Position**: Rest the barbell on your shoulders, similar to a front squat position. Use a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width.
2. **Foot Position**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Squat Down**: Initiate the movement by bending your knees and lowering your hips back, keeping your chest up and core engaged.
2. **Move into Full Squat**: Descend until your thighs are parallel to the ground or lower.
3. **Drive Up**: Push through your heels to rise back up. As you stand, begin to press the barbell overhead.
4. **Overhead Press**: Extend your arms fully at the top of the movement. Ensure your body is in a straight line from the bar to your feet.
5. **Lower the Bar**: Reverse the motion by bringing the bar back to your shoulders while preparing for the next squat.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your elbows high throughout the movement.
- Maintain a neutral spine and avoid leaning forward excessively.
- Engage your core and brace your abdomen.
- Control the movement to avoid losing balance or form.

## Common Mistakes
- Letting the bar drift away from the body.
- Rounding the back during the squat.
- Not using a full range of motion.

## Breathing
- Inhale while squatting down.
- Exhale during the drive up and overhead press.
