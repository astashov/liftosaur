## Starting Position
- Lie on your back on the floor.
- Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground.
- Place your hands behind your head, elbows wide.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles.
2. **Lift Shoulders**: Curl your shoulders off the floor towards your right knee.
3. **Twist**: As you lift, rotate your torso to bring your left elbow towards your right knee.
4. **Return**: Slowly lower back to the starting position without letting your head touch the ground.
5. **Repeat**: Alternate sides, bringing your right elbow toward your left knee for the next repetition.

## Tips
- Keep your movements controlled.
- Avoid pulling on your neck; use your core to lift.
- Ensure your lower back stays in contact with the floor.
- Breathe out as you crunch, and breathe in as you return.
