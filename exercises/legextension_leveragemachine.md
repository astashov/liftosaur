---

### Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat:** Position the seat so your back is supported and knees align with the machine's pivot.
2. **Leg Pad Position:** Adjust the pad so it rests on the lower part of your shins, just above your feet.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:** Sit with your back against the support. Feet should be under the pad, knees bent at a 90-degree angle.
2. **Lift the Weight:** Extend your legs upwards by straightening your knees. Focus on using your quadriceps.
3. **Control the Movement:** Pause briefly at the top of the movement, ensuring the extension is full but avoiding locking out your knees.
4. **Lower the Weight:** Slowly lower the weight back to the starting position while maintaining control.

### Tips
- **Avoid Swinging:** Do not use momentum; focus on a smooth, controlled motion.
- **Breathing:** Exhale while extending, and inhale while lowering.
- **Body Position:** Keep your back pressed against the backrest throughout the exercise.

### Common Mistakes
- Locking knees at the top of the extension.
- Allowing your back to lift from the support.
- Using too much momentum to lift the weight. 

### Warning
- If you feel any sharp pain, discontinue the exercise immediately and reassess your form.
