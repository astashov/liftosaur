---

**Equipment Needed:**
- Resistance band
- Stable chair or bench

**Setup:**
1. Attach one end of the resistance band to a sturdy object (like a chair leg) near the floor.
2. Sit on the chair or bench and loop the other end around your ankle.

**Execution:**
1. Sit up straight with your feet flat on the floor and knees bent at a 90-degree angle.
2. Keep your core engaged and avoid leaning back.
3. Slowly extend your leg by straightening your knee, pushing against the band.
4. Ensure your movements are controlled; don’t lock your knee at the top.
5. Return to the starting position with a slow and controlled motion.
6. Alternate legs as needed.

**Form Tips:**
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid pushing with your hips or using momentum.
- Focus on squeezing your quadriceps at the top of the extension.

**Safety:**
- Ensure the band is securely attached to avoid snapping.
- Choose an appropriate resistance level to maintain control throughout the exercise.
