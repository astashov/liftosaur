## Setup
1. **Barbell Position**: Place the barbell on your upper traps (similar to a back squat).
2. **Feet**: Stand shoulder-width apart with your feet firmly planted.

## Movement
1. **Engage Core**: Brace your core to protect your lower back.
2. **Hip Hinge**: Hinge at the hips, pushing your glutes back while keeping a slight bend in the knees.
3. **Maintain Neutral Spine**: Keep your back straight and head aligned with your spine. Avoid rounding or arching your back.
4. **Depth**: Lower your torso until it’s parallel to the ground or as far as your flexibility allows without losing form.
5. **Return**: Reverse the movement by driving through your hips, keeping your back straight, and returning to the starting position.

## Tips
- **Focus on Control**: Move slowly and with control to avoid injury.
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower, exhale as you return to standing.
- **Footwear**: Use flat shoes or go barefoot for better stability.  

## Common Mistakes
- **Rounding the Back**: Keep your spine neutral to avoid injury.
- **Excessive Knee Bend**: Focus on hinging at the hips rather than bending the knees too much.
- **Looking Up or Down**: Keep your head in line with your spine. 

Following these guidelines will help ensure a safe and effective Barbell Good Morning exercise.
