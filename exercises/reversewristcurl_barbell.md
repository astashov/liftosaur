2. Grip the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down) and arms fully extended.
3. Rest your forearms on your thighs or a bench, allowing your wrists to hang off the edge.

## Execution

2. **Contraction**: Raise the barbell to the highest point comfortably, ensuring your forearms remain stationary.
3. **Return**: Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

- Allowing elbows to move away from the body.

## Benefits
