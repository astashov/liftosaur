## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat Height**: Ensure the seat is set so that the handles align with your chest level.
2. **Select Weight**: Choose an appropriate weight on the machine.

## Grip
1. **Hand Position**: Grasp the handles with a neutral grip, palms facing forward.
2. **Elbow Position**: Your elbows should be at about a 45-degree angle to your body.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Sit back with your back flat against the pad, feet firmly planted on the floor. 
2. **Press**: Push the handles away from your body by extending your arms, exhaling as you push.
3. **Full Extension**: Extend your arms fully without locking your elbows at the top of the movement. 

## Return
1. **Controlled Descent**: Slowly lower the handles back towards your chest. Inhale as you return to the starting position.
2. **Reach Just Above Chest**: Stop just above the chest level to maintain tension in the chest muscles.

## Tips
- Maintain a straight wrist throughout the movement.
- Keep your back flat against the back pad.
- Avoid lifting your feet off the ground. 

By following these steps, you will perform the Leverage Machine Chest Press with proper form, engaging the chest muscles effectively.
