## Starting Position
1. Lie flat on your back on a mat.
2. Keep your legs straight and together, arms at your sides or under your lower back for support.
3. Engage your core muscles.

## Execution
1. **Lift:** Slowly raise both legs towards the ceiling. Keep them straight and together.
2. **Hold:** Bring your legs to about a 45-degree angle. Maintain this position for a moment while keeping your core engaged.
3. **Lower:** Slowly lower your legs back towards the ground without letting them touch it. Stop just before the mat.
4. **Repeat:** Continue the motion for the desired duration.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your back flat against the mat to avoid arching.
- Control the movement, avoiding using momentum.
- Breathe steadily—inhale on the lift, exhale as you lower.
- Focus on maintaining tension in your core throughout the exercise.
