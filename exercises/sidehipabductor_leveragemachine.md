## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat:** Sit on the machine with your back against the backrest. Adjust the seat height if necessary so that your knees are aligned with the machine's pivot point.
2. **Foot Position:** Place your outer thighs against the padded levers. Ensure your feet are flat on the footrests (if applicable).

## Execution
1. **Starting Position:** Keep your feet flat and your core engaged. Your knees should be slightly bent, and your legs should be together.
2. **Movement:** Push the levers outward by spreading your legs apart. Focus on activating your hip abductors.
3. **Control the Return:** Slowly bring your legs back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement. 

## Tips
- **Avoid Locking Knees:** Keep a slight bend in your knees at all times.
- **Engage Core:** Maintain a stable core to support your lower back.
- **Breath Control:** Exhale as you push out, and inhale as you return to the start.
- **Range of Motion:** Use a controlled range of motion to isolate the target muscles effectively.

## Common Mistakes
- **Using Too Much Weight:** Start light to perfect your form before increasing resistance.
- **Not Engaging the Core:** This can lead to improper form and strain on the back.
- **Rushing the Movement:** Focus on control rather than speed to maximize effectiveness.

With practice, this will help strengthen your hip abductors and improve lower body stability.
