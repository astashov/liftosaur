## Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat:** Sit on the machine with your back against the backrest. Adjust the seat height if necessary so that your knees are aligned with the machine's pivot point.
2. **Foot Position:** Place your outer thighs against the padded levers. Ensure your feet are flat on the footrests (if applicable).

## Execution
1. **Starting Position:** Keep your feet flat and your core engaged. Your knees should be slightly bent, and your legs should be together.
2. **Movement:** Push the levers outward by spreading your legs apart. Focus on activating your hip abductors.
3. **Control the Return:** Slowly bring your legs back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement. 

## Tips
- **Avoid Locking Knees:** Keep a slight bend in your knees at all times.
- **Engage Core:** Maintain a stable core to support your lower back.
- **Breath Control:** Exhale as you push out, and inhale as you return to the start.
- **Range of Motion:** Use a controlled range of motion to isolate the target muscles effectively.

## Common Mistakes
- **Using Too Much Weight:** Start light to perfect your form before increasing resistance.
- **Not Engaging the Core:** This can lead to improper form and strain on the back.
- **Rushing the Movement:** Focus on control rather than speed to maximize effectiveness.

With practice, this will help strengthen your hip abductors and improve lower body stability.

### Adjust and Sit
Set the seat height so your knees align with the machine's pivot point when seated. Sit with your back against the backrest and place your outer thighs against the padded levers, feet on the footrests.

### Engage Your Core
Tighten your core to support your lower back throughout the movement. Keep your knees slightly bent at the starting position with legs together.

### Push Outward
Drive the levers apart by spreading your legs, focusing on activating the hip abductors. Control the range of motion to effectively isolate the target muscles.

### Return with Control
Slowly bring your legs back together to the starting position. Exhale as you push out and inhale as you return, avoiding rushing or using momentum.
