## Setup
1. **Position the Machine**: Adjust the leverage machine so the foot plate is at a suitable height for your squatting position.
2. **Select Weight**: Choose an appropriate weight based on your strength and experience level.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Stand on the foot plate with one foot, while the other foot remains lifted off the ground. Engage your core.
2. **Grip Handles**: Hold the machine's handles for stability.
3. **Squatting Motion**:
   - Slowly bend the knee of the standing leg, lowering your body into a squat.
   - Keep your other leg extended in front of you, maintaining balance.
4. **Depth Control**: Descend until your thigh is parallel to the ground, or as low as your flexibility and balance allow.
5. **Return to Start**: Push through the heel of the standing foot, returning to the starting position while maintaining control.

## Tips
- Keep your back straight and chest up throughout the movement.
- Engage your glutes and quadriceps as you lift back up.
- Avoid letting your knees collapse inward; they should track over your toes.
- Start with a lighter weight until you master the form.

## Safety
- Ensure the machine is stable and properly set up before starting.
- If new to the exercise, consider seeking guidance from a fitness professional.
