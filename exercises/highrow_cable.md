### Setup
1. **Equipment:** Use a cable machine with a high pulley.
2. **Attachment:** Attach a wide grip bar or a V-bar to the cable.

### Starting Position
1. **Adjust Weight:** Select an appropriate weight on the machine.
2. **Stand/Pull:** Stand facing the cable machine or sit on a bench (if applicable) with knees slightly bent.
3. **Grip:** Grab the bar with both hands, palms facing each other or facing down, depending on attachment.

### Execution
1. **Positioning:** Lean slightly back while maintaining a straight back. Keep your chest up.
2. **Pull:** Initiate the movement by pulling the bar towards your upper abdomen or chest.
3. **Elbow Path:** Ensure elbows are higher than your wrists as you pull.
4. **Squeeze:** At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
5. **Return:** Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control.

### Tips
- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.
- Avoid leaning too far back; maintain a slight angle.
- Focus on using your back muscles rather than arms to pull the weight.
- Perform the exercise in a fluid motion, avoiding abrupt movements.

### Common Mistakes
- Overextending the back while leaning back too far.
- Using momentum instead of muscle strength to pull.
- Allowing the shoulders to rise toward the ears; keep them away from the ears.

### Conclusion
The Cable High Row effectively targets the upper back and shoulder muscles when performed with proper form. Adjust as needed and focus on technique for optimal results.
