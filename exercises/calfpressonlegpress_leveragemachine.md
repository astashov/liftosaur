## Setup
1. Adjust the seat of the leverage machine so that your knees are slightly bent when your feet are placed on the platform.
2. Position your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, ensuring the balls of your feet are on the edge and your heels are hanging off.

## Execution
1. **Start Position:** Begin with your heels off the platform and your legs extended but not locked out.
2. **Movement:** Lower your heels towards the ground by bending your ankles until you feel a stretch in your calves.
3. **Press Up:** Push through the balls of your feet to lift your heels, extending your ankles. Focus on squeezing your calves at the top of the movement.
4. **Repeat:** Continue the movement in a controlled manner, focusing on a full range of motion.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back against the seat for stability.
- Avoid using your legs to initiate the movement; focus on your calves.
- Control the tempo, especially on the eccentric phase (lowering).
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise. 

## Safety
- Ensure the machine is securely set up before starting.
- Use a weight that allows you to maintain proper form without strain.
