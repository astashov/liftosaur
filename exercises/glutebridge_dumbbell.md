## Starting Position
1. **Lie on Your Back**: Lay flat on your back on a mat, knees bent, feet flat on the ground about hip-width apart.
2. **Feet Placement**: Position your feet closer to your glutes for better activation.
3. **Dumbbell Position**: Hold a dumbbell with both hands over your hips. Secure it with your thumbs under the handle.

## Movement
1. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Lift Your Hips**: Press through your heels and lift your hips towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top.
3. **Avoid Overextending**: Ensure your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees at the peak of the lift.

## Lowering Phase
1. **Control Descent**: Slowly lower your hips back to the mat, maintaining control and tension in your glutes.
2. **Repeat**: Repeat the movement for the duration of your workout.

## Key Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower your hips, exhale as you lift.
- **Alignment**: Keep your knees in line with your toes throughout the movement.
- **Pelvic Tilt**: Perform a slight pelvic tilt before lifting to enhance glute engagement.

## Common Mistakes
- **Arching the Back**: Avoid excessive arching; maintain a neutral spine.
- **Raising the Shoulders**: Keep shoulders grounded on the mat.
- **Using Too Heavy a Dumbbell**: Start with a manageable weight to focus on form.

Following this guide will help you perform the Dumbbell Glute Bridge effectively and safely.
