### Starting Position
1. **Sit on a Bench**: Choose a flat bench or chair.
2. **Hold Dumbbells**: Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing up.
3. **Rest Forearms**: Place your forearms on your thighs, allowing your wrists to hang off the edge.

### Execution
1. **Wrist Movement**: Curl the dumbbells upwards by flexing your wrists. Keep your forearms resting on your thighs throughout the movement.
2. **Controlled Motion**: Lift the dumbbells until your wrists are fully flexed, ensuring a smooth and controlled motion.
3. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, extending your wrists fully without letting the weights drop suddenly.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Maintain a Neutral Back**: Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
- **Avoid Momentum**: Focus on using your wrist muscles rather than swinging your arms.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while curling up and inhale while lowering the weights.
- **Range of Motion**: Ensure full flexion and extension of the wrist for maximum effectiveness.

### Common Mistakes
- **Using Too Much Weight**: Start light to maintain control and form.
- **Bending Elbows**: Keep elbows stationary to isolate the wrist muscles.
- **Rushed Movements**: Perform the exercise slowly to enhance muscle engagement.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Dumbbell Seated Palms Up Wrist Curl with proper form.
