## Equipment Needed
- Resistance band

## Setup
1. **Anchor the Band**: Secure the band under your feet or to a low anchor point.
2. **Grip the Band**: Stand tall, holding the ends of the band with both hands, arms at your sides. 

## Execution
1. **Position**: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with a slight bend in your knees. Stand upright with a neutral spine.
2. **Engage Shoulders**: Pull your shoulders down and back to engage the upper back.
3. **Shrug Movement**: Inhale, then lift your shoulders towards your ears by contracting the trapezius muscles. 
4. **Hold**: Squeeze at the top for a moment while keeping your arms straight.
5. **Lower**: Exhale and slowly lower your shoulders back to the starting position.

## Tips
- **Avoid Leaning**: Keep your torso stable and do not lean forward or backward.
- **Controlled Movement**: Perform the movement slowly to maximize muscle engagement.
- **Breath**: Coordinate your breathing with the movement; inhale while raising and exhale while lowering.

## Common Mistakes
- **Using Excessive Momentum**: Avoid jerking motions; focus on a smooth and controlled lift.
- **Poor Posture**: Maintain an upright posture throughout to prevent strain.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Band Shrug while maintaining proper form and maximizing benefits.
