---

## Setup
- **Equipment**: Use a sturdy pull-up bar or gymnastic rings.
- **Grip**: Overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.

## Steps

1. **Start Position**:
   - Hang from the bar/rings with arms fully extended and feet off the ground. Engage your shoulders.

2. **Pull Up**:
   - Initiate the movement by pulling your chest towards the bar. Focus on driving your elbows down and back.

3. **Transition**:
   - As your chin passes the bar, lean your torso forward. Shift your wrists over the bar/rings.

4. **Push Up**:
   - Transition into a dip by pressing down with your arms, keeping your elbows close to your body. Extend your arms fully at the top.

5. **Finish**:
   - Lock out your arms while keeping your body straight. Hold the top position briefly before lowering yourself back down.

## Key Points
- **Engagement**: Keep core tight throughout to maintain stability.
- **Angles**: Lean forward during the transition phase to enable the push-up part.
- **Practice**: Start with pull-ups and dips to build strength before attempting the muscle-up.

## Safety Tips
- **Warm Up**: Ensure shoulder and wrist mobility before training.
- **Progress Gradually**: Use assisted variations if needed before attempting the full movement. 

Always prioritize form to prevent injury.
