## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a low pulley.
2. **Attachment**: Connect a straight bar or rope attachment to the low pulley.
3. **Positioning**: Stand facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the bar or rope with an overhand grip.

## Execution
1. **Grip**: Keep arms straight down, holding the bar/rope in front of your thighs.
2. **Starting Position**: Stand tall with a neutral spine and relaxed shoulders.
3. **Movement**: Inhale and raise your shoulders straight up toward your ears without bending your elbows. 
4. **Contraction**: Hold the top position for a moment, feeling the contraction in your trapezius muscles.
5. **Return**: Exhale as you lower your shoulders back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Avoid leaning forward**: Keep your torso upright throughout the movement.
- **Focus on the traps**: Ensure the movement is initiated from your shoulders, not your arms.
- **Control the weight**: Avoid using momentum; the movement should be slow and deliberate.
- **Breathing**: Exhale on the upward movement and inhale on the way down.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the elbows to bend.
- Rounding the shoulders forward.
- Using excessive weight leading to poor form.

By adhering to proper form, the Cable Shrug effectively targets the trapezius muscles and supports shoulder stability.
