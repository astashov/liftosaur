### Equipment Needed
- Resistance band (preferably one with handles)
- Anchor point (door anchor or secure pole)

### Setup
1. **Anchor the Band**: Attach the band to a secure anchor at chest height.
2. **Position Yourself**: Stand facing away from the anchor point, holding the handles with both hands.

### Execution
1. **Grip**: Hold the band handles with palms facing down and elbows bent at a 90-degree angle.
2. **Stance**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart for stability. 
3. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to maintain balance throughout the movement.
4. **Press**: Push the band forward by extending your arms until they are fully extended. Keep the elbows slightly bent at the end position.
5. **Control Return**: Slowly bring your hands back to the starting position, maintaining control of the band.

### Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and back throughout the movement.
- Avoid arching your back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Adjust band tension by moving closer or farther from the anchor point as needed. 

### Breathing
- Inhale as you return to the starting position. Exhale while pressing forward.
