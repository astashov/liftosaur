### Equipment Needed
- Resistance band (preferably one with handles)
- Anchor point (door anchor or secure pole)

### Setup
1. **Anchor the Band**: Attach the band to a secure anchor at chest height.
2. **Position Yourself**: Stand facing away from the anchor point, holding the handles with both hands.

### Execution
1. **Grip**: Hold the band handles with palms facing down and elbows bent at a 90-degree angle.
2. **Stance**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart for stability. 
3. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to maintain balance throughout the movement.
4. **Press**: Push the band forward by extending your arms until they are fully extended. Keep the elbows slightly bent at the end position.
5. **Control Return**: Slowly bring your hands back to the starting position, maintaining control of the band.

### Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and back throughout the movement.
- Avoid arching your back; maintain a neutral spine.
- Adjust band tension by moving closer or farther from the anchor point as needed. 

### Breathing
- Inhale as you return to the starting position. Exhale while pressing forward.

### Anchor and Position
Attach the resistance band to a secure anchor at chest height. Stand facing away from the anchor, holding the handles with palms facing down and elbows bent at 90 degrees.

### Set Your Stance
Place your feet shoulder-width apart for stability and engage your core to maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.

### Press Forward
Extend your arms fully forward by pressing the band handles out until your elbows are almost straight. Keep your shoulders down and back during the press.

### Control the Return
Slowly bring your hands back to the starting position, resisting the band tension throughout. Adjust your distance from the anchor to modify resistance as needed.
