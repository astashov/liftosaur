## Steps:

1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width apart.
   - Position the barbell over the mid-foot.
   - Point toes slightly outward.

2. **Grip the Bar:**
   - Bend at the hips and knees to lower your body.
   - Grasp the bar with a grip slightly narrower than shoulder width (palms facing you or mixed grip).

3. **Set Your Back:**
   - Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and engage your core.
   - Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.

4. **Initiate the Pull:**
   - Push through your heels as you extend your hips and knees simultaneously to lift the bar.
   - Keep the bar close to your body, dragging it up along the thighs.

5. **Execute the High Pull:**
   - As the bar passes your knees, engage your shoulders and begin to pull the bar up.
   - Extend your elbows and pull the bar towards your chin, using your legs and hips for upward momentum.

6. **Finish Position:**
   - At the peak of the pull, your elbows should be above your wrists, and the bar should be close to your body.
   - Hold the contraction briefly.

7. **Lower the Bar:**
   - Reverse the motion by lowering the bar back down in a controlled manner.
   - First, lower your elbows, then the bar, keeping it close to your body.
   - Return to the starting position.

## Tips for Proper Form:
- Keep your weight balanced on your heels.
- Avoid rounding your back; maintain spine alignment.
- Focus on engaging your entire posterior chain during the lift.
- Always practice with light weights to master form before increasing load.

## Safety:
- Ensure a clear environment to prevent injury.
- Use lifting shoes or a flat-soled shoe for stability.
