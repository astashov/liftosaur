### Setup
1. **Position the Bar:** Adjust the bar at chest height in the Smith Machine.
2. **Grip the Bar:** Stand facing the bar; use a shoulder-width grip or cross-arm grip.

### Execution
1. **Bar Placement:** Step under the bar, resting it on the front of your shoulders. Ensure it’s comfortably positioned.
2. **Stance:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out.
3. **Engage Core:** Tighten your core and maintain a neutral spine.
4. **Squat Down:** Lower your body by bending at the hips and knees, keeping your elbows high to prevent the bar from rolling.
5. **Depth:** Aim to squat until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor or lower if flexibility allows.
6. **Push Through Heels:** Drive through your heels to return to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

### Tips
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning forward.
- Ensure the knees track over your toes; do not let them cave inwards.
- Start with light loads to master the form before increasing weight.
