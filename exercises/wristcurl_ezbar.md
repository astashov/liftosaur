### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use an EZ bar.
2. **Grip**: Stand or sit holding the EZ bar with an underhand grip (palms facing up), shoulder-width apart.

### Execution
1. **Positioning**: Rest your forearms on a flat surface (e.g., your thighs or a bench) while allowing your wrists to hang off. Keep your elbows close to your body.
2. **Movement**: 
   - Curl the EZ bar upward by flexing your wrists.
   - Keep your forearms stationary; only your wrists should move.
3. **Peak Contraction**: Squeeze at the top of the movement, holding for a moment.
4. **Lowering**: Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent.

### Tips
- Keep your back straight and avoid using momentum.
- Focus on engaging the forearm muscles throughout the exercise.
- Ensure a full range of motion for maximum effectiveness.
