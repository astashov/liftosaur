---

## Setup
1. **Equipment:** Use a cable machine with a rope attachment.
2. **Positioning:** Stand facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart. Set the cable pulley to the lowest position.

## Grip
1. **Hold the Rope:** Grab the rope attachment with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
2. **Elbow Position:** Keep your elbows close to your torso.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position:** With arms fully extended, let the weight pull your arms down. This is your starting position.
2. **Curl Movement:** Keeping your elbows stationary, curl the rope upward by flexing your elbows and bringing your hands towards your shoulders.
3. **Peak Contraction:** Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement while keeping the wrists neutral.
4. **Lowering:** Slowly lower the rope back to the starting position, fully extending your arms without letting the weight stack touch.

## Tips
- **Posture:** Maintain a straight back and avoid leaning forward or backward during the curl.
- **Controlled Movement:** Focus on slow, controlled movements to maximize muscle tension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale while curling and inhale while lowering the weight.

## Common Mistakes
- **Swinging:** Avoid using momentum; focus on isolating the biceps.
- **Incorrect Elbow Position:** Keeping elbows flared out can reduce the effectiveness; keep them close to your body.

Remember to adjust the weight according to your fitness level to maintain proper form throughout the exercise.
