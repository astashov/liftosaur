### Starting Position
1. **Stance**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip**: Grip the barbell with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width.
3. **Body Position**: Keep your hips lower than your shoulders, back straight, and chest up.

### The Clean
1. **Initial Lift**:
   - Push through your heels and lift the barbell off the ground.
   - Keep the bar close to your body as you rise.

2. **First Pull**:
   - Extend your knees while keeping your back straight.
   - Before the bar reaches your knees, begin to extend your hips.

3. **Second Pull**:
   - Once the barbell passes your knees, explosively extend your hips and knees.
   - Shrug your shoulders up and pull the barbell upwards.

4. **Catch Phase**:
   - As the bar reaches its highest point, drop under it by bending your knees.
   - Rotate your elbows around the bar to catch it on your shoulders.

### Final Position
- Stand up with the barbell resting on your shoulders, elbows high, and chest up.
- Your feet should be hip-width apart.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Keep the bar close**: Maintain proximity between the bar and your body throughout the lift.
- **Engage your core**: Keep your core tight to protect your lower back.
- **Look forward**: Maintain a neutral neck position and avoid looking up or down excessively.
- **Practice with lighter weights**: Focus on technique before increasing load. 

### Common Mistakes
- **Incorrect grip**: Ensure your hands are at a comfortable width.
- **Lifting with the back**: Rely on your legs and hips for power, not your back.
- **Not fully extending**: Make sure to fully extend your hips and knees in the second pull for maximum height.

### Conclusion
Mastering the barbell clean requires practice and attention to form. Consider working with a coach if you're new to Olympic lifting to refine your technique further.
