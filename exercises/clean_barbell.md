### Starting Position
1. **Stance**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip**: Grip the barbell with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width.
3. **Body Position**: Keep your hips lower than your shoulders, back straight, and chest up.

### The Clean
1. **Initial Lift**:
   - Push through your heels and lift the barbell off the ground.
   - Keep the bar close to your body as you rise.

2. **First Pull**:
   - Extend your knees while keeping your back straight.
   - Before the bar reaches your knees, begin to extend your hips.

3. **Second Pull**:
   - Once the barbell passes your knees, explosively extend your hips and knees.
   - Shrug your shoulders up and pull the barbell upwards.

4. **Catch Phase**:
   - As the bar reaches its highest point, drop under it by bending your knees.
   - Rotate your elbows around the bar to catch it on your shoulders.

### Final Position
- Stand up with the barbell resting on your shoulders, elbows high, and chest up.
- Your feet should be hip-width apart.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Keep the bar close**: Maintain proximity between the bar and your body throughout the lift.
- **Engage your core**: Keep your core tight to protect your lower back.
- **Look forward**: Maintain a neutral neck position and avoid looking up or down excessively.
- **Practice with lighter weights**: Focus on technique before increasing load. 

### Common Mistakes
- **Incorrect grip**: Ensure your hands are at a comfortable width.
- **Lifting with the back**: Rely on your legs and hips for power, not your back.
- **Not fully extending**: Make sure to fully extend your hips and knees in the second pull for maximum height.

### Conclusion
Mastering the barbell clean requires practice and attention to form. Consider working with a coach if you're new to Olympic lifting to refine your technique further.

### Set Your Starting Position
Stand over the bar with feet shoulder-width apart. Grip just outside your knees with a double overhand grip, hips lower than shoulders, chest up, and back straight.

### Execute the First Pull
Push through your heels and extend your knees while keeping your back angle constant. Keep the bar close to your shins as it rises from the floor.

### Drive Through the Second Pull
Once the bar passes your knees, explosively extend your hips and knees simultaneously. Shrug your shoulders and pull the bar upward, keeping it tight to your body.

### Catch on Your Shoulders
Drop under the bar by bending your knees and rotating your elbows around and under the bar to catch it on your front deltoids. Stand up fully to complete the lift.
