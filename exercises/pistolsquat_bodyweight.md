---

## Starting Position
1. Stand on one leg with your other leg extended in front of you.
2. Keep your core engaged and your chest up.

## Descent
1. Initiate the squat by sitting back and bending the knee of the standing leg.
2. Extend the other leg forward, keeping it straight and parallel to the floor.
3. Lower your body as far as you can while maintaining balance.

## Depth
1. Aim to go down to at least parallel, with your knee over your ankle.
2. Ensure your torso leans slightly forward to maintain balance.

## Ascent
1. Push through the heel of the standing leg to rise back up.
2. Engage your glutes and hamstrings as you lift.
3. Maintain control throughout the movement, avoiding any jerky motions.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your knee aligned with your toes during the squat.
- Use your arms for balance; extend them in front of you as needed.
- Practice with supported variations (e.g., using a wall or TRX) if full pistol squats are challenging. 

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the knee to collapse inward.
- Losing balance by leaning too far forward or backward.
- Neglecting to engage the core, which can lead to instability. 

Remember to focus on control, balance, and form throughout the movement.
