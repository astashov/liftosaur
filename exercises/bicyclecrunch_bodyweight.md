### Starting Position
1. Lie flat on your back on a mat.
2. Place your hands behind your head, elbows wide.
3. Lift your legs, bending at the knees at a 90-degree angle, feet off the ground.

### Execution
1. Engage your core and lift your shoulder blades off the mat.
2. Bring your right knee toward your chest while simultaneously rotating your torso to bring your left elbow towards the right knee.
3. Switch sides by extending your right leg while bringing your left knee toward your chest and rotating your torso to touch your right elbow to the left knee.
4. Continue alternating sides in a controlled manner.

### Key Points
- Keep your lower back pressed into the mat to avoid arching.
- Move slowly and focus on the twisting motion rather than speed.
- Avoid pulling on your neck; use your core to lift.
- Breathe steadily, exhaling with each twist.

### Finish
- Alternate sides for the desired duration, maintaining form throughout.
