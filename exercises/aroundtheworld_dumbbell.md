## Starting Position
- Stand or sit upright with a dumbbell in both hands.
- Hold the dumbbell vertically with arms extended in front of you, at chest level.

## Execution
1. **Movement Initiation**: Begin by raising the dumbbell up and over your head in a circular motion.
2. **Arc Path**: Move the dumbbell behind your head and lower it toward your back while keeping your arms slightly bent. 
3. **Return Path**: Continue the circular motion by bringing the dumbbell down and back to the starting position in front of your chest.
4. **Control**: Maintain control throughout the movement, keeping your core engaged to stabilize your body.

## Form Tips
- Keep your elbows slightly bent to avoid strain on your joints.
- Maintain a neutral spine and avoid arching your back.
- Use a slow and controlled tempo to ensure safety and effectiveness.
- Breathe steadily: exhale during the upward phase and inhale during the return.

## Common Mistakes
- Overextending the arms or arching the back.
- Using momentum instead of engaging muscles.
- Holding the dumbbell too tightly, which can lead to tension in the forearms.

## Benefits
- Strengthens shoulders, chest, and triceps.
- Enhances shoulder stability and mobility. 
- Improves coordination and balance.

Always consult a fitness professional if you're unsure about technique or form.
