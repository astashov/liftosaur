## Setup
1. **Adjust the Smith Machine**: Set the bar at shoulder height.
2. **Select Your Weight**: Load the appropriate weight plates onto the bar.

## Positioning
1. **Stand under the Bar**: Position yourself so that the bar rests just above your collarbones.
2. **Grip the Bar**: Use a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, palms facing forward.

## Execution
1. **Feet Placement**: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, firmly planted on the ground.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your torso.
3. **Lift the Bar**: Push the bar directly upwards until your arms are fully extended overhead without locking your elbows.
4. **Lower the Bar**: Slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

## Tips
- Keep your back straight and avoid arching.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position.
- Breathe out as you press up and inhale as you lower the bar. 

## Common Mistakes
- Arching the back excessively.
- Using legs to push the bar instead of shoulders.
- Allowing the elbows to flare out excessively during the press.

Following these steps will help ensure you perform the Smith Machine Shoulder Press safely and effectively.
