**Starting Position:**
1. Lie on your back on a flat surface. 
2. Place your arms at your sides or under your hips for support.
3. Lift your legs so that your thighs are perpendicular to the ground and your knees are bent at 90 degrees.

**Execution:**
1. Engage your core by pulling your navel towards your spine.
2. Exhale and use your lower abs to lift your hips off the ground, curling your pelvis towards your belly button.
3. Keep your knees bent and close to your chest as you lift.
4. Pause for a second at the top of the movement.
5. Inhale and slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position without letting your feet touch the ground.
6. Maintain control throughout the movement to avoid using momentum.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your lower back pressed against the ground.
- Avoid using your hands to push off or assist; use your core strength.
- Focus on a smooth, controlled motion both up and down.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Lifting your feet too high instead of keeping them close to the body.
- Letting the lower back arch off the ground.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movements.
