### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and weights. Ensure that the barbell is on a flat surface.
2. **Foot Position**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. The barbell should be positioned over the mid-foot.

### Starting Position
1. **Grip the Barbell**: Bend at the hips, keeping your chest up and back straight. Grip the barbell with both hands, slightly wider than shoulder-width.
2. **Body Alignment**: Shoulders should be slightly in front of the bar, and your spine should remain neutral.

### Execution
1. **Lift**: Engage your core, push through your heels, and straighten your hips and knees simultaneously to lift the barbell. Keep it close to your body.
2. **Hip Hinge**: Focus on hinging at the hips rather than bending at the knees. Your knees should remain slightly bent.
3. **Bar Path**: The barbell should travel in a straight line from the ground to mid-thigh. 

### Lowering the Bar
1. **Hinge at the Hips**: Reverse the movement by pushing your hips back. Maintain a flat back and neutral spine as you lower the barbell.
2. **Keep Close**: The bar should stay close to your legs throughout the descent until it returns to the ground.

### Notes
- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the bar and exhale as you lift.
- **Focus on Form**: Avoid rounding your back or locking your knees during the lift.
- **Range of Motion**: Lower the bar down to your mid shin or until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.

### Safety Tips
- Start with lighter weights to master form.
- Consider using lifting straps if grip is an issue. 

This movement primarily targets the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back.
