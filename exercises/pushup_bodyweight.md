1. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Bend your elbows to lower your body towards the ground.
   - Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle, pointing back, not flaring out.

2. **Raising Phase**:
   - Press through your palms to push your body back up to the starting position.
   - Maintain a straight back and tight core throughout the movement.

## Key Points

- Avoid sagging your hips or raising your buttocks.
- Ensure full range of motion for optimal effectiveness.
