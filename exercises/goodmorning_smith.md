## Setup
1. **Position the Bar**: Adjust the Smith machine bar to shoulder height.
2. **Foot Placement**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place the bar across your upper traps.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body.
2. **Hip Hinge**: Slightly bend your knees and hinge at the hips, pushing your hips back while keeping your back straight and chest up.
3. **Lowering**: Continue to lower your torso until it is nearly parallel to the ground, maintaining a neutral spine.
4. **Raising**: Drive through your hips and return to the starting position by engaging your glutes and hamstrings.

## Tips
- Keep your head in a neutral position, looking forward.
- Avoid rounding your back; maintain a straight, neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Control the movement and avoid sudden jerks or fast motions.
