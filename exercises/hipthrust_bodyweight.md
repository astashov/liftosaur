---

## Starting Position
1. Sit on the ground with your upper back against a bench or a sturdy surface.
2. Roll a barbell or place a weight plate over your hips for added resistance (if using weights).
3. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.

## Movement
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Lift Hips**: Drive through your heels and thrust your hips upward. Your body should form a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.
3. **Squeeze Glutes**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your glutes tightly and hold for a moment.

## Lowering
1. Slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position while keeping control of the movement.

## Key Points
- Keep your chin tucked and eyes looking forward.
- Focus on using your glutes, not your lower back.
- Ensure your feet remain flat, and knees stay aligned with your toes.
- Avoid arching your back excessively at the top of the lift.

## Common Mistakes
- Overextending the back instead of using the glutes.
- Not placing feet close enough to the body.
- Allowing knees to cave inwards.

By following this guide, you can perform the bodyweight hip thrust safely and effectively to strengthen your glutes and improve overall hip movement.

### Position Against the Bench
Sit on the ground with your upper back resting on a bench. Bend your knees and place feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.

### Engage Your Core
Tighten your abdominal muscles before lifting to stabilize your spine throughout the movement.

### Drive Your Hips Up
Press through your heels and thrust your hips upward until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. Squeeze your glutes at the top and hold briefly.

### Lower with Control
Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position. Focus on glute engagement rather than lower back extension.
