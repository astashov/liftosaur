## Starting Position
1. Lie flat on your back on a mat.
2. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
3. Place your hands behind your head or crossed over your chest.
4. Engage your core by drawing your navel towards your spine.

## Movement
1. Inhale and prepare to move.
2. Exhale as you lift your shoulder blades off the ground, curling your upper body towards your knees.
3. Keep your lower back pressed into the mat to avoid strain.
4. Hold at the top for a moment, ensuring your chin stays away from your chest.
5. Inhale as you slowly lower back to the starting position.

## Tips
- Avoid pulling on your neck with your hands; support your head gently.
- Focus on using your abdominal muscles to lift, not your neck or back.
- Keep your movements controlled to maximize engagement of the core.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting the legs off the ground; keep them stable.
- Overextending the neck; maintain a neutral head position.
- Using momentum rather than controlled contraction. 

Following these guidelines will help you perform bodyweight crunches effectively and safely.

### Curl Your Shoulder Blades Off the Mat
Exhale as you lift your shoulder blades off the ground, curling your upper body toward your knees. Keep your chin away from your chest throughout.

### Lower with Control
Inhale as you slowly lower back to the starting position. Use your abdominal muscles to control the descent rather than dropping.
