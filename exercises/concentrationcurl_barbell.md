**Starting Position:**
1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the floor, legs apart.
2. Hold a barbell with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
3. Rest the elbow of the working arm against the inside of your thigh.

**Execution:**
1. Keep your back straight and core engaged.
2. Curl the barbell upward towards your shoulder, focusing on using your bicep.
3. Squeeze at the top of the movement for maximum contraction.
4. Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, fully extending the arm.

**Key Points:**
- Ensure minimal movement in your elbow; only your forearm should move.
- Maintain a controlled motion, avoiding swinging or using momentum.
- Keep your opposite arm relaxed on your lap or resting on your thigh.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using too much weight, leading to form breakdown.
- Allowing the elbow to move away from the thigh.
- Not fully extending the arm at the bottom of the movement. 

### Tips:
- Focus on the muscle being worked to enhance the mind-muscle connection.
- Ensure breathing is controlled: exhale on the lift and inhale on the lowering phase.
