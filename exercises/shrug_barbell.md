### Starting Position
1. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold a barbell with both hands using a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width.
3. Allow the barbell to rest against your thighs, arms fully extended.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight to stabilize your body.
2. **Lift Shoulders**: Raise your shoulders straight up towards your ears. Avoid rolling your shoulders forward or backward.
3. **Pause**: Hold the peak position for a brief moment while maintaining tension in your traps.
4. **Lower Shoulders**: Slowly lower your shoulders back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

### Key Points
- Keep your neck neutral; avoid leaning your head forward or backward.
- Maintain a straight back throughout the movement.
- Focus on using your trapezius muscles rather than using momentum.
