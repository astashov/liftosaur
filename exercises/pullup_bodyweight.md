## Starting Position
1. **Grip the Bar**: Use an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. **Hang**: Fully extend your arms, allowing your body to hang straight down. Keep your shoulders relaxed, not shrugged.

## Execution
1. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles. This stabilizes your body throughout the movement.
2. **Pull Up**: Initiate the movement by pulling your elbows down towards your sides. Focus on using your back and arms.
3. **Lift**: Bring your chin above the bar by squeezing your shoulder blades together and driving your elbows down.
4. **Controlled Descent**: Lower your body back to the starting position slowly, avoiding a sudden drop.

## Key Points
- Keep your body straight and avoid swinging.
- Maintain a controlled motion both up and down.
- Breathe in as you lower and exhale as you pull up.

## Common Mistakes
- **Swinging the Body**: Keep your legs still to prevent momentum.
- **Incomplete Range of Motion**: Ensure your chin clears the bar at the top and you fully extend your arms at the bottom.
- **Shrugging Shoulders**: Keep shoulders relaxed to engage the back muscles effectively.
