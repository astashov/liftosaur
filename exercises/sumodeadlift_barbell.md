## Starting Position
1. **Stance**: Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width and toes pointed slightly outward.
2. **Bar Position**: Position the barbell over the midfoot.

## Grip
1. **Hand Placement**: Bend at the hips and knees to lower down. Use a mixed grip (one palm facing you, one facing away) or a double overhand grip.
2. **Shoulder Position**: Keep your shoulders slightly in front of the bar.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core and maintain a neutral spine.
2. **Pull**: Drive through your heels, extend your legs, and lift the bar by thrusting your hips forward.
3. **Stand Tall**: Fully extend your hips and knees at the top of the lift, keeping your shoulders back.

## Lowering the Bar
1. **Hinge at the Hips**: Push your hips back while keeping the bar close to your body.
2. **Bend Knees**: Once the bar passes your knees, bend your knees to lower it to the ground.

## Tips
- Maintain a flat back throughout the movement.
- Avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Keep your weight distributed evenly across your feet.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing shoulders to drop too far down.
- Overextending at the top.
- Letting the bar drift away from the body during the lift.

By following these steps, you can perform the Barbell Sumo Deadlift with proper form to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury.
