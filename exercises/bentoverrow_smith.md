**Setup:**
1. **Position the Bar:** Adjust the Smith machine bar to waist height.
2. **Foot Placement:** Stand in front of the bar, feet shoulder-width apart.

**Starting Position:**
1. **Grip the Bar:** Bend at the hips and knees to grasp the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.
2. **Body Angle:** Keep your back straight, hinge at the hips, and lean forward until your torso is about 45 degrees to the floor.

**Execution:**
1. **Engage Core:** Tighten your core to maintain stability throughout the movement.
2. **Pull the Bar:** Row the bar towards your lower ribcage, leading with your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
3. **Control the Movement:** Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position while maintaining control.

**Tips:**
- Keep your back flat and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Maintain a neutral neck position; don’t look up or down excessively.
- Focus on muscle contraction rather than using momentum to lift the weight.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Rounding the back, which can lead to injury.
- Lifting with arms instead of engaging the back muscles.
- Using too much weight, causing poor form.

**Safety Considerations:**
- Use a weight that allows you to maintain proper form.
- Ensure the bar is securely locked in the Smith machine.
