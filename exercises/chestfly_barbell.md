## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a flat bench and a barbell.
2. **Positioning**: Lie down on your back on the bench, feet flat on the floor or on the bench.

## Grip
1. **Hand Placement**: Hold the barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip Type**: Use an overhand grip (palms facing forward).

## Starting Position
1. **Elbows**: Extend your arms above your chest, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
2. **Barbell Position**: The barbell should be directly above your chest.

## Execution
1. **Lowering Phase**: 
   - Slowly lower the barbell out to the sides, maintaining the slight bend in your elbows.
   - Aim for a stretch in your chest without letting your elbows drop too low.

2. **Bottom Position**: 
   - Stop when your elbows are level with your chest or slightly below, ensuring you feel a stretch.

3. **Lifting Phase**: 
   - Raise the barbell back to the starting position, following the same path.
   - Maintain control and do not let the weights crash together at the top.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering the barbell and exhale while lifting it.
- **Focus on Movement**: Engage your chest muscles throughout the entire movement.
- **Avoid Excessive Weight**: Prioritize form over weight to prevent injury.

## Common Mistakes
- Dropping elbows too low, risking shoulder strain.
- Lifting too much weight, leading to improper form.
- Swinging the barbell instead of controlled movement.

## Conclusion
The barbell chest fly is effective for targeting pectoral muscles when performed with the correct form. Ensure to maintain control throughout the exercise for maximum benefit and safety.
