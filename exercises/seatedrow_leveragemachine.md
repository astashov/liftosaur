**Setup:**
1. Adjust the seat height so that your feet rest flat on the foot platform.
2. Sit with your back against the pad and grasp the handles with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).

**Positioning:**
1. Ensure your knees are bent and securely under the pads.
2. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart.

**Execution:**
1. Start with your arms fully extended, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.
2. Engage your core and keep your back straight throughout the movement.
3. Pull the handles towards your torso while driving your elbows back, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. Focus on using your back muscles rather than your arms to initiate the pull.
5. Pause briefly when the handles reach your torso.

**Return:**
1. Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position while keeping control of the movement.
2. Avoid leaning back or rounding your back during the return phase.

**Tips:**
- Keep your movements smooth and controlled.
- Avoid using momentum; focus on muscle engagement.
- Adjust the weight as needed to maintain proper form throughout the exercise.
