### Setup
1. **Bar Placement**: Position the barbell on your upper back, either on the traps (high bar) or rear deltoids (low bar).
2. **Grip**: Grip the bar with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width, keeping elbows pointing down and back.
3. **Feet Position**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.

#### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Brace your core and lift the bar off the rack.
2. **Descent**:
   - Initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously.
   - Keep your chest up and back straight throughout the movement.
   - Lower until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground, or deeper if flexibility allows.

3. **Ascend**: 
   - Push through your heels and straighten your knees.
   - Maintain an upright torso and keep your core engaged as you return to standing.

#### Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering, exhale while ascending.
- **Knees**: Ensure knees track over toes and do not cave inward.
- **Depth**: Aim for a depth that allows you to maintain form without compromising safety.

#### Common Mistakes
- Leaning too far forward.
- Allowing knees to cave in.
- Lifting heels off the ground.

Maintain proper form to enhance effectiveness and reduce risk of injury.
