## Setup
1. **Position the Smith Machine Bar**: Adjust the bar to chest height.
2. **Select a Bench**: Place a flat bench underneath the bar, ensuring it's centered.
3. **Grip**: Use a wide grip on the bar (slightly wider than shoulder-width) to emphasize the chest.

## Execution
1. **Lie Down**: Position yourself on the bench with your eyes aligned under the bar.
2. **Plant Feet**: Keep your feet flat on the ground, maintaining stability.
3. **Unrack the Bar**: Lift the bar by straightening your arms, then rotate it to unhook it.
4. **Lower the Bar**: Slowly lower the bar towards your chest, controlling the movement. Your elbows should be at about a 75-degree angle from your body.
5. **Press Up**: Push the bar back to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking your elbows.

## Tips
- Keep your back flat against the bench.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position throughout the movement.
- Focus on controlled movements to avoid injury.
