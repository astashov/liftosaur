## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with two high pulleys.
2. **Adjust Pulleys**: Set the pulleys to the highest position.

## Positioning
1. **Attach Handles**: Secure handles to both pulleys.
2. **Stand Center**: Position yourself in the middle of the machine.
3. **Grab Handles**: With a slight bend in your elbows, grasp a handle in each hand.

## Stance
1. **Feet Placement**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Body Posture**: Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and core engaged.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Pull the cable handles to the sides, forming a "T" shape with your arms.
2. **Movement**:
   - **Bring Handles Together**: Slowly bring the handles in front of your chest, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.
   - **Squeeze**: Focus on squeezing your chest muscles at the peak of the movement.

3. **Return**: Gradually return to the starting position, ensuring control throughout.

## Key Points
- Maintain a stable core.
- Avoid excessive lean or arching of the back.
- Control the movement to prevent jerking or swinging.

## Breathing
- Exhale while bringing handles together.
- Inhale as you return to the starting position.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing elbows to lock out.
- Swinging or using momentum instead of muscle control.
- Leaning too far forward or backward.

Follow these instructions to effectively perform the cable crossover with proper form.

### Set Up the Machine
Set both cable pulleys to the highest position and attach handles. Stand in the center of the machine with feet shoulder-width apart, chest up, and core engaged.

### Establish the Starting Position
Grasp one handle in each hand with a slight elbow bend. Pull the handles out to your sides, forming a "T" shape with your arms before beginning.

### Bring Handles Together
Slowly sweep the handles forward and inward in front of your chest, maintaining the slight elbow bend throughout. Squeeze your chest muscles at the point where the handles meet.

### Return with Control
Gradually return to the starting "T" position, allowing the chest to stretch under load. Inhale as you return and exhale as you bring the handles together.
