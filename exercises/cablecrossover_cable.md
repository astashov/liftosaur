## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with two high pulleys.
2. **Adjust Pulleys**: Set the pulleys to the highest position.

## Positioning
1. **Attach Handles**: Secure handles to both pulleys.
2. **Stand Center**: Position yourself in the middle of the machine.
3. **Grab Handles**: With a slight bend in your elbows, grasp a handle in each hand.

## Stance
1. **Feet Placement**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Body Posture**: Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and core engaged.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Pull the cable handles to the sides, forming a “T” shape with your arms.
2. **Movement**: 
   - **Bring Handles Together**: Slowly bring the handles in front of your chest, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.
   - **Squeeze**: Focus on squeezing your chest muscles at the peak of the movement.

3. **Return**: Gradually return to the starting position, ensuring control throughout.

## Key Points
- Maintain a stable core.
- Avoid excessive lean or arching of the back.
- Control the movement to prevent jerking or swinging.

## Breathing
- Exhale while bringing handles together.
- Inhale as you return to the starting position. 

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing elbows to lock out.
- Swinging or using momentum instead of muscle control.
- Leaning too far forward or backward. 

Follow these instructions to effectively perform the cable crossover with proper form.
