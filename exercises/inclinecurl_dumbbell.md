### Setup
1. **Incline Bench**: Set an incline bench at a 30-45 degree angle.
2. **Dumbbells**: Grab a pair of dumbbells and sit on the bench with your back against it.

#### Starting Position
1. **Grip**: Hold the dumbbells with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
2. **Elbow Placement**: Let your arms hang down, fully extended, with elbows close to your body.

#### Execution
1. **Curl Movement**: 
   - Keep your upper arms stationary.
   - Exhale and curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders by bending at the elbows.
2. **Full Range**: Raise the dumbbells until your forearms are vertical and the biceps are fully contracted.

#### Lowering Phase
1. **Controlled Descent**: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control.

#### Tips for Proper Form
- **Avoid Using Momentum**: Keep the movement slow and controlled.
- **Maintain Posture**: Keep your back flat against the bench without arching.
- **Focus on Elbow Position**: Ensure elbows stay close to the body throughout the movement.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Lifting Too Heavy**: This can cause form breakdown and reduce effectiveness.
- **Swinging Arms**: Avoid using body sway to lift the weights.

### Conclusion
Performing dumbbell incline curls with proper form enhances bicep engagement and muscle growth. Keep the focus on controlled movements and correct posture.
