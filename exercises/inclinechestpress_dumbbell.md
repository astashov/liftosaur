### Setup
1. **Bench Position**: Set an adjustable bench to a 30-45 degree incline.
2. **Dumbbells**: Choose a pair of dumbbells and sit on the bench with them resting on your thighs.

### Starting Position
1. **Lie Back**: Carefully lie back on the bench while bringing the dumbbells to shoulder level.
2. **Grip**: Use a neutral grip (palms facing forward).
3. **Feet**: Keep your feet flat on the floor for stability.

### Movement
1. **Press Up**: Push the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended, but not locked.
2. **Control Descent**: Lower the dumbbells slowly to chest level, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your torso.

### Key Points
- **Shoulders**: Keep your shoulders down and back throughout the movement.
- **Core**: Engage your core to maintain stability.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while pressing up and inhale while lowering.

### Finish
1. **End Position**: At the bottom, the dumbbells should be in line with your chest.
2. **Reset**: For the next repetition, bring the dumbbells back to the starting position on your thighs before starting again.

### Tips
- **Avoid Arching**: Don’t arch your back excessively; maintain a neutral spine.
- **Avoid Excessive Weight**: Choose a weight that allows you to maintain proper form throughout the exercise.
