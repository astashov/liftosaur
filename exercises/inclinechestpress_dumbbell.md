2. **Dumbbells**: Choose a pair of dumbbells and sit on the bench with them resting on your thighs.

### Starting Position

2. **Grip**: Use a neutral grip (palms facing forward).
3. **Feet**: Keep your feet flat on the floor for stability.

### Movement

### Key Points

- **Core**: Engage your core to maintain stability.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while pressing up and inhale while lowering.

### Finish

2. **Reset**: For the next repetition, bring the dumbbells back to the starting position on your thighs before starting again.
