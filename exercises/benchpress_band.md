## Equipment Needed
- Resistance bands
- Flat bench

## Setup
1. **Secure the Bands**: Anchor the resistance bands under the legs of the bench or use a band peg if available.
2. **Position the Bands**: Loop the bands over your chest area or through the handles if using handles.

## Starting Position
1. **Lie Down**: Position yourself on the bench with your back flat and feet firmly planted on the floor.
2. **Grip the Bands**: Grab the bands with both hands at shoulder-width, palms facing forward.

## Execution
1. **Start Position**: Begin with your hands near your chest, elbows bent at a 45-degree angle.
2. **Press Upward**: Push the bands upward until your arms are fully extended without locking your elbows.
3. **Control the Descent**: Slowly lower the bands back to the starting position, keeping control throughout the movement.

## Key Form Tips
- **Keep Wrists Straight**: Maintain a neutral wrist position to avoid strain.
- **Engage Core**: Keep your core tight for stability.
- **Use Full Range of Motion**: Ensure the bands are stretched adequately at the top of the movement.

## Common Mistakes
- **Elbows Flared Out**: Maintain a 45-degree angle to protect your shoulders.
- **Arching the Back**: Ensure your back remains flat against the bench.

By following these steps and tips, you'll execute the Band Bench Press with proper form for optimal benefits.
