### Equipment Needed
- Resistance band
- Bench or elevated surface

### Steps

1. **Setup**: 
   - Sit on the ground with your upper back against the bench.
   - Loop the resistance band around your hips and anchor it under the bench or use a heavy object.

2. **Positioning**: 
   - Roll back so your shoulder blades are resting on the bench.
   - Place your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Your knees should be bent at 90 degrees.

3. **Engage Core**: 
   - Brace your core and ensure your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees when you lift.

4. **Lift Hips**: 
   - Press through your heels and lift your hips toward the ceiling.
   - Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.

5. **Lower Down**: 
   - Slowly lower your hips back toward the ground, maintaining control.

6. **Repetition**: 
   - Repeat the movement while focusing on maintaining proper form.

### Tips
- Keep your chin tucked to avoid arching your back.
- Focus on using your glutes to lift your hips, not your lower back.
- Ensure the band is securely anchored throughout the exercise.
