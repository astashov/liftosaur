## Starting Position
1. **Stand Up**: Feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Hold Dumbbells**: Position them at shoulder height with palms facing forward.

## Execution
1. **Dip Slightly**: Bend your knees slightly, lowering your hips while keeping your torso upright.
2. **Drive Up**: Explosively extend your legs and push through your heels while pressing the dumbbells overhead.
3. **Fully Extend Arms**: Finish the movement with your arms fully extended above your head, wrists aligned with elbows.
4. **Lower Dumbbells**: Bring the dumbbells back to shoulder height with control after the press.

## Key Points
- **Core Engagement**: Keep your core tight throughout the movement.
- **Neutral Spine**: Maintain a straight back and avoid excessive leaning.
- **Breathing**: Inhale when lowering the weights, exhale while pressing up.
- **Control**: Avoid using momentum; focus on a smooth, controlled motion. 

## Common Mistakes
- Overextending or arching the back.
- Uneven weight distribution between arms.
- Flaring elbows out too much during the press.

Following these guidelines will help ensure a safe and effective Dumbbell Push Press.
