## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band with handles.
2. **Positioning**: Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Loop the band around your feet and hold a handle in each hand.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Lean back slightly with your torso at a 45-degree angle. Your arms should be extended straight in front of you, parallel to the ground.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body throughout the movement.
3. **Movement**: 
   - Simultaneously lift your legs off the ground while pulling the band towards your chest, forming a "V" shape with your body.
   - Your torso should incline backward as your legs come up; maintain a strong core to keep balance.
4. **Hold**: Keep this position briefly, ensuring your core is engaged and the band is taut.
5. **Return**: Slowly lower your legs and arms back to the starting position while maintaining control.

## Tips
- Avoid straining your neck; keep your head aligned with your spine.
- Maintain a steady breathing pattern throughout the exercise.
- Adjust the tension on the band as needed for your fitness level.
