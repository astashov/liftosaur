## Setup
1. **Cable Machine**: Attach a straight or EZ curl bar to a low pulley.
2. **Seating**: Sit on a bench close to the machine, with your feet planted on the floor.

## Execution
1. **Grip**: Using one hand, grab the bar with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
2. **Positioning**: Rest your elbow on the inside of your thigh, keeping your arm extended fully downward.
3. **Curl Movement**: Engage your bicep to curl the bar upwards towards your shoulder while keeping your elbow stationary against your thigh.
4. **Contraction**: Squeeze the bicep at the top of the movement, ensuring no momentum or swinging.
5. **Lowering**: Slowly return to the starting position, controlling the motion.

## Tips
- Maintain a straight back for stability.
- Focus on a slow, controlled motion to maximize muscle engagement.
- Switch arms after completing the desired repetitions.
