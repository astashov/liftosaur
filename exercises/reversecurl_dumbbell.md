## Starting Position
1. Stand upright with a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Hold the dumbbells at your sides with an overhand grip (palms facing down).
3. Feet should be shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to maintain stability.
2. **Curl Up**: Keeping your elbows close to your body, flex your arms and raise the dumbbells towards your shoulders.
3. **Maintain Control**: Avoid swinging; the movement should be smooth and controlled.
4. **Pause**: Briefly hold the dumbbells at the top of the movement.
5. **Lower Down**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning back.
- Ensure your elbows do not flare out; they should stay tucked in.
- Focus on using your forearm and bicep muscles to lift the weights.
- Perform the movement at a steady pace for optimal control.

## Common Mistakes
- Swinging the weights rather than using muscle control.
- Letting elbows drift away from the body.
- Arching the back or leaning too far forward. 

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Dumbbell Reverse Curl while minimizing the risk of injury.
