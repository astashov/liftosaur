### Setup:
1. **Position Yourself**: Stand on the platform of the leverage machine with your shoulders under the padded bar.
2. **Foot Placement**: Feet should be hip-width apart, ensuring the balls of your feet are on the edge of the platform.

### Execution:
1. **Starting Position**: Begin with your heels hanging off the platform. Your legs should be straight but not locked.
2. **Raise the Weight**: Push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels as high as possible. Focus on using your calf muscles.
3. **Peak Contraction**: Hold the top position briefly to maximize contraction.
4. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower your heels below the platform level, stretching the calves without bouncing.
5. **Repeat**: Continue the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips:
- Maintain a controlled motion throughout the lift and descent.
- Keep your core engaged for stability.
- Avoid using momentum; focus on the muscle working.
- Ensure your knees remain straight throughout the exercise.
