## Starting Position
1. **Feet**: Stand hip-width apart with a slight bend in your knees.
2. **Dumbbells**: Hold a dumbbell in each hand, arms fully extended at your sides.
3. **Posture**: Keep your chest up and shoulders back.

## Execution
1. **Hip Hinge**: Push your hips back while maintaining a slight bend in your knees. 
2. **Lower the Dumbbells**: Lower the dumbbells along your legs, keeping them close to your body. Your torso should lean forward, creating a straight line from head to hips.
3. **Depth**: Lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, ideally until your torso is parallel to the floor.
4. **Return**: Push through your heels and drive your hips forward to return to the starting position, squeezing your glutes at the top.

## Key Points
- Keep your back straight throughout the movement.
- Avoid rounding your shoulders or back.
- Maintain a neutral neck position, looking ahead.
- Focus on engaging your hamstrings and glutes during the lift. 

## Common Mistakes
- Bending the knees too much.
- Rounding the back.
- Using arms instead of engaging the hips for movement. 

## Tips
- Start with lighter weights to perfect form.
- Practice the hip hinge movement without weights to build muscle memory.
