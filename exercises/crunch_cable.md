## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a rope attachment.
2. **Position**: Kneel a few feet away from the machine, holding the rope with both hands. Adjust the pulley height to be around head level.

## Proper Form
1. **Starting Position**: 
   - Kneel on the floor, facing the machine.
   - Grasp the rope with both hands, keeping your elbows bent.
   - Engage your core and keep your back straight.

2. **Movement**:
   - Exhale and pull the rope down towards your knees by flexing your spine.
   - Avoid using your arms; focus on contracting your abdominal muscles.
   - Ensure your hips remain stable and do not shift forward.

3. **Ending Position**:
   - Continue to crunch until your elbows reach your knees or your chest comes down towards your thighs.
   - Hold the contraction for a moment, feeling the tension in your abs.

4. **Return**:
   - Inhale as you slowly return to the starting position, allowing your abs to stretch under control.
   - Maintain tension on the cable without fully relaxing your core.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid pulling with your arms; focus on core activation.
- Keep your movements controlled to maximize effectiveness and minimize injury risk.
