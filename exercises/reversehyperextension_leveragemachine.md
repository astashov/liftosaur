### Setup
1. **Position Yourself**: Sit on the reverse hyperextension machine with your hips positioned at the edge of the platform.
2. **Feet Placement**: Strap your feet into the footpads or secure them under the pads, ensuring a firm grip.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Keep your legs extended straight down towards the floor. 
2. **Engagement**: Engage your core and squeeze your glutes to stabilize your torso.
3. **Lift Leg**: Raise your legs up towards the ceiling in a controlled motion, ensuring your hips stay pressed against the pad.
4. **Peak Contraction**: Hold the top position briefly to maximize glute engagement.
5. **Lower Back**: Gradually lower your legs back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Breathing**: Exhale while lifting your legs and inhale as you lower them.
- **Avoid Swinging**: Perform the movement slowly to avoid momentum and reduce the risk of injury.
- **Body Alignment**: Keep your back neutral and avoid arching or rounding during the exercise.

### Common Mistakes
- **Hip Rolling**: Ensure your hips remain flat against the pad during movement.
- **Overextending**: Don’t hyperextend your back; focus on glute engagement.

### Benefits
- Strengthens the posterior chain, particularly the glutes and hamstrings.
- Improves hip mobility and stability.

Make sure to adjust the machine settings to fit your body proportions for optimal results.
