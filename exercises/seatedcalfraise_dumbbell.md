### Starting Position
1. **Sit on a Bench:** Use a bench with your feet flat on the floor, knees at 90 degrees.

### Execution
1. **Foot Position:** Lift your heels off the ground, keeping the balls of your feet on the floor.
2. **Ankle Motion:** Raise your heels as high as possible by pushing through the balls of your feet.
3. **Pause:** Hold the top position for a moment to maximize contraction.
4. **Lowering Phase:** Slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position, feeling a stretch in your calves.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Maintain Upright Posture:** Keep your back straight and avoid leaning forward or backward.
- **Controlled Movement:** Ensure movements are smooth and controlled, avoiding any bouncing.
- **Avoid Excessive Weight:** Focus on form over weight to prevent injury.
- **Breathing:** Exhale while lifting your heels; inhale while lowering.

### Common Mistakes
- **Leaning Forward:** Keep your torso upright.
- **Using Momentum:** Avoid jerking movements; maintain control.
- **Partial Range of Motion:** Ensure you go through the full range, from the lowest position to fully raised.

### Summary
