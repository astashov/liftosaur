### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a rope attachment.
2. **Adjust the Pulley**: Set the pulley to a mid or low position, depending on your height and comfort.

### Execution
1. **Stance**: Stand facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart, and knees slightly bent.
2. **Grip**: Grab the rope with both hands, palms facing inwards, and take a few steps back to create tension in the cable.
3. **Starting Position**: Hold the rope in front of you, arms extended, elbows slightly bent, and maintain a neutral spine.

### Movement
1. **Retract Shoulders**: Pull your shoulder blades back and down to engage the upper back.
2. **Rowing Motion**: Pull the rope towards your face, leading with your elbows. Keep your upper arms parallel to the floor.
3. **Squeeze**: At the peak of the movement, pause and squeeze your shoulder blades together to maximize rear delt engagement.

### Return
1. **Controlled Release**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position while maintaining tension on the cable.
2. **Avoid Locking Elbows**: Keep your elbows slightly bent to prevent joint strain.

### Posture
- Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise.
- Maintain a neutral spine; avoid rounding your back.
- Avoid excessive swinging or momentum; focus on control.

### Common Mistakes
- **Poor Posture**: Avoid rounding or hyper-extending your back.
- **Using Momentum**: Focus on a controlled movement without swinging.
- **Too Much Weight**: Start light to perfect form before increasing resistance.

### Key Tips
- Focus on slow, controlled movements.
- Breathe out while pulling the rope in, and inhale while returning.
- Maintain tense engagement in your core and upper back throughout the exercise.
