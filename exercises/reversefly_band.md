## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band with handles.
2. **Starting Position**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the band with both hands in front of you, arms extended. 

## Execution
1. **Grip**: Hold the band with palms facing each other. Ensure the band is taut.
2. **Posture**: Slightly bend your knees and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. **Movement**: With a controlled motion, pull the band apart, extending your arms out to the sides at shoulder height. 
4. **Focus on Form**: Keep a slight bend in your elbows and engage your shoulder blades, squeezing them together at the peak of the movement.
5. **Return**: Slowly bring your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.

## Key Points
- Keep your core engaged to support your back.
- Avoid using momentum; focus on a slow and controlled movement.
- Ensure the movement is felt in your rear deltoids and upper back. 

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the shoulders to shrug up towards the ears.
- Overextending the arms beyond shoulder height. 
- Using too much resistance, leading to improper form.

### Set Up the Band
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold the band with both hands in front of you, arms extended and band taut. Ensure palms face each other.

### Hinge Forward
Slightly bend your knees and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight. This positions your torso to isolate the rear deltoids.

### Pull Apart
With a controlled motion, pull the band apart by extending your arms out to the sides at shoulder height, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the peak.

### Return to Start
Slowly bring your arms back to the starting position in front of you, maintaining control and core engagement throughout.
