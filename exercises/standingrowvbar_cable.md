---

## Equipment Needed
- Cable machine
- V-bar attachment

## Starting Position
1. **Adjust the Cable Pulley**: Set the pulley to a low position.
2. **Attach V-Bar**: Secure the V-bar to the cable.
3. **Stand Firmly**: Stand facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart.
4. **Grip the V-Bar**: Use an overhand grip on the V-bar, arms extended towards the cable.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to maintain stability.
2. **Pull the Bar**: As you exhale, pull the V-bar towards your torso.
3. **Elbows Close**: Keep your elbows close to your body and avoid flaring them out.
4. **Squeeze Shoulder Blades**: At the peak of the pull, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
5. **Control the Return**: Inhale while slowly returning to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Arching the Back**: Keep a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- **Using Momentum**: Focus on using muscle strength to pull, not momentum.
- **Flaring Elbows**: Maintain elbows close to the torso for better form and muscle engagement.

## Tips
- Adjust the weight to ensure controlled movements.
- Maintain a slight bend in the knees for stability.
- Focus on engaging the upper back muscles for maximum benefit.
