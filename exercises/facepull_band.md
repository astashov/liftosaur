### Equipment Needed
- Resistance band
- Anchor point (like a door or pole)

### Starting Position
1. **Anchor the band** at chest height.
2. **Stand facing the band** with feet shoulder-width apart.
3. **Grab the band** with both hands, palms down, and arms extended.

### Execution
1. **Pull the band** towards your face, leading with your elbows.
2. **Keep your elbows high**, aligning them with your shoulders.
3. **Squeeze your shoulder blades** together as you pull the band close.
4. **Keep your wrists straight** and in line with your forearms.
5. **Return to the starting position** in a controlled manner, fully extending your arms.

### Key Points
- Maintain a neutral spine; avoid leaning back.
- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.
- Focus on slow and controlled movements for maximum tension on the muscles.
  
### Muscles Targeted
- Rear deltoids

- Allowing the wrists to bend. 

This exercise helps improve shoulder stability and strengthen the upper back.
