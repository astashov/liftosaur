Extend your arms forward with the band taut. Keep a neutral spine and engage your core throughout the movement.

### Pull Toward Your Face
Pull the band toward your face by leading with your elbows, keeping them high and aligned with your shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the end of the pull.
