description: "Build core strength with the Ab Wheel Rollout, targeting the entire abdominal wall, hip flexors, and lower back through a challenging rolling motion."
---

**Starting Position:**
1. Kneel on the floor with a mat for support.
2. Grip the handles of the ab wheel with both hands, shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your knees hip-width apart.

**Execution:**
1. **Engage Core:** Before you move, tighten your core muscles.
2. **Roll Forward:** Slowly roll the wheel forward, extending your body. Keep your arms straight and control your movement to avoid letting your back sag.
3. **Max Extension:** Extend until you feel a stretch in your abs without compromising your lower back position. Your body should form a straight line from your knees to your head.
4. **Roll Back:** Engage your core as you pull the wheel back towards you, returning to the starting position. Focus on using your abdominal muscles rather than your arms or back.

**Key Points:**
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid letting your hips drop to prevent lower back strain.
- Move in a controlled manner to maximize core engagement.

**Breathing:**
- Inhale while rolling forward.
- Exhale as you pull back to the starting position.

**Tips:**
- Start with a limited range of motion if you're new to the exercise.
- Progressively increase your range of motion as you gain strength and confidence.

### Caution
Consult a fitness professional if you have any pre-existing conditions or concerns before attempting this exercise.

### Start in the Kneeling Position
Kneel on a mat with the ab wheel in front of you, gripping the handles shoulder-width apart. Keep your knees hip-width apart and your core already braced.

### Engage Your Core
Tighten your abdominal muscles before initiating any movement. This protects your lower back throughout the entire rollout.

### Roll Forward
Slowly roll the wheel forward, extending your arms and torso toward the ground. Maintain a straight line from knees to head and keep your back from sagging.

### Reach Max Extension
Extend until you feel a strong stretch in your abs. Stop before your lower back begins to arch or lose its neutral position.

### Pull Back
Drive your core muscles to pull the wheel back toward your knees. Focus on your abs doing the work rather than your arms or shoulders.
