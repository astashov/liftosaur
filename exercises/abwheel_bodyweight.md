**Starting Position:**
1. Kneel on the floor with a mat for support.
2. Grip the handles of the ab wheel with both hands, shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your knees hip-width apart.

**Execution:**
1. **Engage Core:** Before you move, tighten your core muscles.
2. **Roll Forward:** Slowly roll the wheel forward, extending your body. Keep your arms straight and control your movement to avoid letting your back sag.
3. **Max Extension:** Extend until you feel a stretch in your abs without compromising your lower back position. Your body should form a straight line from your knees to your head.
4. **Roll Back:** Engage your core as you pull the wheel back towards you, returning to the starting position. Focus on using your abdominal muscles rather than your arms or back.

**Key Points:**
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid letting your hips drop to prevent lower back strain.
- Move in a controlled manner to maximize core engagement.

**Breathing:**
- Inhale while rolling forward.
- Exhale as you pull back to the starting position.

**Tips:**
- Start with a limited range of motion if you're new to the exercise.
- Progressively increase your range of motion as you gain strength and confidence.
