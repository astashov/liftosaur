---

### Equipment Needed:
- Cable machine
- Barbell attachment

#### Setup:
1. **Position Yourself**: Stand sideways to the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Adjust the Cable**: Set the cable handle at the lowest setting and attach the barbell.

#### Execution:
1. **Grip the Bar**: Hold the barbell with both hands, palms facing down, arms extended in front of your chest, and elbows slightly bent.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core and maintain a neutral spine.
3. **Rotate**: Slowly twist your torso away from the machine, pivoting on your back foot, while keeping your hips steady.
4. **Return**: Rotate back to the starting position in a controlled manner.

#### Tips:
- **Do Not Rush**: Focus on a slow and controlled movement to engage core muscles effectively.
- **Breathe**: Exhale during the twist and inhale while returning.
- **Maintain Balance**: Keep your knees slightly bent for stability.

#### Common Mistakes:
- Avoid leaning forward or backward excessively.
- Do not use momentum; the twist should come from your core, not your arms.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Barbell Cable Twist safely and effectively.
