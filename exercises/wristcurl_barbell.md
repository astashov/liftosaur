### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and a flat bench or you can stand.
2. **Grip**: Stand or sit with your forearms resting on your thighs or a flat surface, palms facing up, and hands gripping the barbell.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Allow the barbell to roll down to your fingers, extending your wrists fully.
2. **Curl Movement**: Flex your wrists upward, lifting the barbell as high as possible. Keep your forearms in contact with your thighs or the surface.
3. **Peak Contraction**: Hold the top position briefly to maximize the contraction in your forearms.
4. **Lowering**: Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, controlling the movement to avoid momentum.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Elbows**: Keep your elbows close to your body; avoid moving them during the exercise.
- **Wrist Movement**: Focus on isolating the wrist and not involving the forearms or shoulders.
- **Breathing**: Exhale on the upward motion and inhale as you lower the weight.

### Common Mistakes
- Using excessive weight, which compromises form.
- Allowing elbows to move away from the body.
- Quick, uncontrolled movements rather than slow and intentional.

### Conclusion
Maintain proper form to effectively target the forearm muscles and reduce the risk of injury.
