## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Find a sturdy bench, chair, or parallel bars.
2. **Positioning**: Sit on the edge with your hands beside your hips, fingers pointing forward.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Feet flat on the ground, knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Your body should be close to the bench.
2. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows until they reach a 90-degree angle.
   - Keep your elbows tucked close to your body.
3. **Upward Phase**:
   - Press through your palms to raise your body back to the starting position.
   - Fully extend your arms without locking your elbows.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears.
- Maintain a straight back throughout the movement.
- Move in a controlled manner to avoid swinging.
  
## Common Mistakes
- Letting elbows flare out.
- Dropping too low (going beyond a 90-degree angle).
- Not keeping the core engaged, leading to sagging hips.

## Variations
- For added difficulty, elevate your feet on another surface.
- Use a resistance band for assistance if needed.
