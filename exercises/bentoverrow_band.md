### Setup
1. **Stand on the Band**: Place a resistance band under your feet, shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip the Band**: Bend down and grab the ends of the band with both hands, palms facing each other.

### Positioning
3. **Knees**: Slightly bend your knees to maintain stability.
4. **Hinge at the Hips**: Bend forward at the hips while keeping your back straight, creating a 45-degree angle with your torso.

### Execution
5. **Pull the Band**: Engage your core and pull the band towards your lower ribs. Elbows should stay close to your body.
6. **Squeeze Shoulder Blades**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
7. **Lower the Band**: Slowly lower the band back to the starting position while maintaining control.

### Key Points
- Keep your back straight to avoid rounding.
- Maintain a neutral neck position; look slightly ahead, not down.
- Control both the pulling and lowering phases of the movement. 

### Breathing
- Inhale on the way down and exhale as you pull the band towards you. 

### Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back.
- Letting elbows flare out away from the body.

This exercise targets the upper back, shoulders, and biceps effectively when performed with proper form.
