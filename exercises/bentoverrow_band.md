description: "Strengthen the upper back and biceps with the Band Bent Over Row, using a resistance band to build pulling strength in a hip-hinged position."
---

### Setup
1. **Stand on the Band**: Place a resistance band under your feet, shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip the Band**: Bend down and grab the ends of the band with both hands, palms facing each other.

### Positioning
3. **Knees**: Slightly bend your knees to maintain stability.
4. **Hinge at the Hips**: Bend forward at the hips while keeping your back straight, creating a 45-degree angle with your torso.

### Execution
5. **Pull the Band**: Engage your core and pull the band towards your lower ribs. Elbows should stay close to your body.
6. **Squeeze Shoulder Blades**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
7. **Lower the Band**: Slowly lower the band back to the starting position while maintaining control.

### Key Points
- Keep your back straight to avoid rounding.
- Maintain a neutral neck position; look slightly ahead, not down.
- Control both the pulling and lowering phases of the movement.

### Breathing
- Inhale on the way down and exhale as you pull the band towards you.

### Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back.
- Letting elbows flare out away from the body.

This exercise targets the upper back, shoulders, and biceps effectively when performed with proper form.

### Stand on the Band and Hinge
Place the resistance band under your feet shoulder-width apart and grip the ends with palms facing each other. Hinge at the hips to a 45-degree torso angle with knees slightly bent.

### Set Your Core
Engage your core and keep your back flat with a neutral neck position before initiating the pull.

### Pull to the Lower Ribs
Drive both elbows back and pull the band toward your lower ribcage. Keep elbows close to your body and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top.

### Lower with Control
Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position while maintaining tension. Inhale on the way down and exhale as you pull.
