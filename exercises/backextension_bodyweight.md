**Starting Position:**
- Lie face down on a mat or soft surface, with your legs extended straight behind you.
- Place your hands behind your head or crossed over your chest.
- Keep your feet hip-width apart and anchored to the ground.

**Movement:**
1. **Engage Core:** Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Lift Upper Body:** Gently raise your chest off the ground by extending your spine. Aim to lift until your torso is about parallel to the ground. 
3. **Keep Neck Neutral:** Maintain a neutral head position by looking slightly ahead, avoiding excessive neck extension.
4. **Squeeze Glutes:** As you lift, engage your glutes to stabilize the movement and support your lower back.

**Return to Start:**
- Slowly lower your upper body back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

**Tips:**
- Maintain a smooth and controlled movement without jerking.
- Breathe out as you lift and inhale as you lower.
- Focus on using your back muscles rather than pushing with your arms.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Hyperextending the neck or lower back.
- Using arms to pull up rather than engaging the back and glutes.
- Lifting too high, which can strain the back. 

This exercise strengthens the lower back, glutes, and hamstrings. Perform it with proper form to ensure safety and effectiveness.
