---

**Starting Position:**
- Lie face down on a mat or soft surface, with your legs extended straight behind you.
- Place your hands behind your head or crossed over your chest.
- Keep your feet hip-width apart and anchored to the ground.

**Movement:**
1. **Engage Core:** Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Lift Upper Body:** Gently raise your chest off the ground by extending your spine. Aim to lift until your torso is about parallel to the ground.
3. **Keep Neck Neutral:** Maintain a neutral head position by looking slightly ahead, avoiding excessive neck extension.
4. **Squeeze Glutes:** As you lift, engage your glutes to stabilize the movement and support your lower back.

**Return to Start:**
- Slowly lower your upper body back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

**Tips:**
- Maintain a smooth and controlled movement without jerking.
- Breathe out as you lift and inhale as you lower.
- Focus on using your back muscles rather than pushing with your arms.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Hyperextending the neck or lower back.
- Using arms to pull up rather than engaging the back and glutes.
- Lifting too high, which can strain the back.

This exercise strengthens the lower back, glutes, and hamstrings. Perform it with proper form to ensure safety and effectiveness.

### Set the Starting Position
Lie face down on a mat with legs extended and feet hip-width apart anchored to the ground. Place hands behind your head or crossed over your chest.

### Engage Your Core
Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine before lifting. This protects your lower back throughout the movement.

### Lift the Upper Body
Raise your chest off the ground by extending your spine, aiming for your torso to reach parallel to the floor. Keep your neck neutral by looking slightly ahead.

### Squeeze and Hold
Engage your glutes as you reach the top position to support your lower back. Avoid hyperextending beyond a neutral back position.

### Lower with Control
Slowly return your upper body to the mat, maintaining control throughout. Exhale on the way up and inhale on the way down.
