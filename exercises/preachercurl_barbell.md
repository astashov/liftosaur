description: "Isolate your biceps with the Barbell Preacher Curl, resting upper arms on the preacher pad and curling the bar upward with strict, controlled movement."
---

## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a preacher bench and a barbell.
2. **Positioning**: Sit on the bench and adjust the height so your upper arms rest comfortably on the padding.

## Grip
1. **Hand Position**: Grip the barbell with an underhand grip (palms facing up), slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Begin with the barbell at arm's length, fully extended, and your arms hanging down.
2. **Curl**: Engage your biceps and curl the barbell upward by bending your elbows. Keep your upper arms pressed against the padding.
3. **Peak Contraction**: Continue curling until the barbell reaches shoulder level. Hold for a moment for peak contraction.
4. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, fully extending your arms while maintaining control.

## Tips
- Keep your elbows stationary and close to your body throughout the movement.
- Avoid swinging or using momentum; focus on controlled movements.
- Breathe out while curling up and inhale while lowering the barbell.

## Common Mistakes
- Letting elbows rise off the pad.
- Using too much weight, leading to poor form.
- Not controlling the eccentric (lowering) part of the lift.

## Conclusion
Maintain proper form to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury.
