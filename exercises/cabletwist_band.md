description: "Strengthen the obliques and core with the Band Cable Twist, using resistance band tension to train rotational core strength from a standing position."
---

**Equipment Needed:** Resistance band or cable machine

**Starting Position:**
1. Attach the resistance band to a stable anchor point at about waist height.
2. Stand side-on to the anchor point, feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the band with both hands, keeping your elbows slightly bent and your hands at chest level.

**Execution:**
1. Engage your core throughout the movement.
2. Rotate your torso away from the anchor point while keeping your hips facing forward.
3. Pull the band across your body, using your core muscles to generate the movement, not your arms.
4. Complete the twist until your hands are in line with your shoulders.
5. Slowly return to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

**Tips for Proper Form:**
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning.
- Ensure your hips remain stable during the twist.
- Breathe out as you twist, and inhale as you return to the starting position.
- Adjust the tension of the band for appropriate resistance.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Overusing the arms instead of engaging the core.
- Rotating the hips rather than the torso.
- Allowing the band to pull you rather than maintaining control.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively perform the Band Cable Twist while minimizing the risk of injury and maximizing engagement of your core muscles.

### Anchor the Band and Set Your Stance
Attach the resistance band to a stable point at waist height. Stand side-on to the anchor with feet shoulder-width apart and grasp the band with both hands at chest level, elbows slightly bent.

### Engage Your Core
Tighten your core before initiating any rotation. Keep your hips stable and facing forward throughout the movement.

### Rotate Away from the Anchor
Twist your torso away from the anchor point, driving the movement from your core rather than your arms. Continue until your hands reach shoulder-line alignment.

### Return with Control
Slowly rotate back to the starting position, resisting the band's pull. Exhale during the twist and inhale as you return.
