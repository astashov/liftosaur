### Equipment Needed
- Cable machine with a low pulley
- Ankle strap attachment

### Setup
1. **Attach Ankle Strap**: Secure the ankle strap to the low pulley of the cable machine.
2. **Adjust Weight**: Set an appropriate weight on the machine.
3. **Position Yourself**: Stand facing away from the machine. Attach the ankle strap to your ankles and take a step forward to create tension in the cable.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Lie on your back on a mat or bench, grasping the sides for support. Keep your knees bent and feet elevated off the ground.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body.
3. **Pull Up**: Gradually pull your knees towards your chest, driving with your hips while maintaining a controlled movement.
4. **Control Descent**: Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position, ensuring not to let your feet touch the ground.
5. **Repeat**: Maintain a steady rhythm throughout the exercise.

### Tips
- Focus on using your abdominal muscles rather than momentum.
- Keep your movements slow and controlled for maximum effectiveness.
- Ensure that your back remains flat against the mat or bench during the exercise to protect your spine.

### Common Mistakes
- Using too much weight, which can compromise form.
- Lifting the upper body off the ground excessively.
- Allowing the feet to touch the ground between repetitions. 

By following this guide, you can perform the Cable Reverse Crunch with proper form to effectively target your abdominal muscles.
