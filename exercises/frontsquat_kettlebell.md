### Setup
1. **Position the Kettlebell**: Hold a kettlebell in front of you with both hands. Your palms should be facing towards you, with the kettlebell resting against your chest. 

2. **Stance**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.

#### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your torso.

2. **Squat Down**: Push your hips back and bend your knees, lowering your body into a squat. Keep your elbows close to your body and your chest up.

3. **Depth**: Go as low as your flexibility allows while maintaining a neutral spine and ensuring your knees track over your toes.

4. **Ascend**: Press through your heels to return to the starting position, straightening your legs and pushing your hips forward.

#### Tips for Proper Form
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Keep your weight distributed evenly on your feet.
- Avoid letting your knees buckle inward.
- Keep the kettlebell close to your body during the squat.

### Common Mistakes
- Leaning too far forward.
- Not squatting low enough.
- Losing balance or letting the kettlebell drift away from the chest.

### Safety
- Use a weight that allows you to maintain proper form.
- Ensure a clear space around you to prevent injury.
