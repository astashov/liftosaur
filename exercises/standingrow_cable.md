## Starting Position
1. **Attach Handle**: Connect a single handle to the low pulley of a cable machine.
2. **Stand**: Face the machine, feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent.
3. **Grip**: Hold the handle with one hand, palm facing in, and take a step back to create tension in the cable.

## Execution
1. **Posture**: Stand tall with your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and core engaged.
2. **Starting Movement**: Pull the handle towards your torso while bending your elbow.
3. **Elbow Position**: Keep your elbow close to your body as you row the handle.
4. **Retract Scapula**: Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the end of the movement.
5. **Controlled Return**: Slowly extend your arm back to the starting position, maintaining tension in your back muscles.

## Tips
- Avoid leaning back; keep your torso upright.
- Focus on engaging your back, not just your arms.
- Use a slow, controlled motion to maximize muscle engagement.
