### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band. Choose a band that provides moderate resistance.
2. **Positioning**: Lie on your back on a mat with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Place the resistance band just above your knees.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your pelvis.
2. **Foot Placement**: Ensure your feet are shoulder-width apart and flat on the ground.
3. **Lift Hips**: Press through your heels, squeezing your glutes, and lift your hips towards the ceiling. Your body should form a straight line from shoulders to knees at the top.
4. **Band Tension**: Keep the tension on the band by pushing your knees outward slightly throughout the movement.
5. **Hold and Lower**: Pause at the top for a moment, feeling the glute contraction, then slowly lower your hips back to the starting position.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid overextending your back; focus on using your glutes.
- Ensure your knees don’t collapse inward; they should track over your feet.

### Breathing
- Inhale as you lower your hips and exhale as you lift them.
