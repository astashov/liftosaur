### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with adjustable pulleys.
2. **Bench Positioning**: Place a flat bench in the middle of the cable machine.
3. **Pulley Adjustment**: Set the cable pulleys to the lowest position.

#### Execution
1. **Grip the Handles**: Stand facing away from the machine. Grab the cable handles with an overhand grip (palms facing away) or underhand grip (palms facing you), depending on your preference.
2. **Lying Position**: Lie down on the bench with your feet flat on the floor. Position the handles at chest level, elbows bent at about 90 degrees.
3. **Starting Position**: Keep your shoulder blades retracted and your back flat against the bench.
4. **Press Upwards**: Extend your arms straight up while keeping a slight bend in the elbows; this prevents locking out your joints.
5. **Control the Descent**: Slowly lower the handles back to the starting position while maintaining tension in your chest muscles.

#### Tips
- **Breathing**: Exhale while pressing up and inhale while lowering.
- **Elbow Position**: Keep your elbows at an angle of about 45 degrees to your body to avoid shoulder strain.
- **Core Engagement**: Maintain tension in your core for stability throughout the movement.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Overextending**: Avoid locking your elbows at the top of the press.
- **Arching the Back**: Keep your back flat against the bench to protect your lower back.
- **Rushing the Movement**: Focus on controlled movements to maximize efficiency and minimize injury risk.
