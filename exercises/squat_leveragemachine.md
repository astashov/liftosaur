## Setup
1. **Adjust the Machine**: Set the seat height and foot platform to match your body size. Your knees should align with the pivot point when seated.
2. **Foot Position**: Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform. You can adjust the position for targeting different muscle groups (higher for glutes, lower for quads).

## Starting Position
1. **Sit Down**: Sit with your back firmly against the pad and ensure your shoulders are under the shoulder pads.
2. **Engage Core**: Brace your core to maintain stability throughout the movement.

## Execution
1. **Grip Handles**: Hold onto the machine handles for balance.
2. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly bend your knees and lower your body, keeping your back straight and chest up. Go down until your thighs are parallel to the floor or slightly below.
3. **Knees Alignment**: Make sure your knees do not travel past your toes to avoid strain.
4. **Ascending Phase**: Push through your heels to return to the starting position, engaging your leg muscles. Ensure your back maintains contact with the pad.

## Tips
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering your body, and exhale while pushing back up.
- **Posture**: Keep your back neutral and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- **Concentration**: Focus on controlled movements rather than speed.

## Safety
- **Weight Check**: Ensure the machine is properly loaded with appropriate weights to prevent injury.
- **Spotter**: If necessary, have a spotter to assist during heavy lifts.

By following these guidelines, you can safely and effectively perform the Leverage Machine Squat for optimal results.
