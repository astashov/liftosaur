---

### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a barbell and a bench with back support.
2. **Grip**: Position your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width on the barbell.
3. **Seating**: Sit on the bench with your back firmly against the support and feet flat on the floor.

### Starting Position
1. **Bar Position**: Lift the barbell to shoulder height, resting it across your upper chest and front deltoids.
2. **Elbow Position**: Keep elbows slightly in front of the bar and pointed downwards.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core and maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
2. **Pressing Motion**: Push the barbell upward in a straight line above your head, fully extending your arms but not locking out elbows.
3. **Control Descent**: Lower the barbell back to shoulder height under control, keeping elbows engaged.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms.
- Avoid arching your back; maintain a straight posture.
- Ensure your head is in a neutral position, looking forward as you press.

### Safety
- Use a spotter or safety bars if lifting heavy weights.
- Start with lighter weight to master the form before increasing load. 

### Common Mistakes
- Arching the back excessively during the press.
- Letting elbows flop out to the side instead of keeping them aligned.
- Not engaging the core, which can destabilize the lift. 

By following these steps, you can effectively perform the seated overhead press with proper form, maximizing benefits and minimizing injury risk.
