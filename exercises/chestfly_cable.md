### Setup
1. **Position Yourself**: Stand in the center of a cable machine with pulleys set at chest height.
2. **Grab the Handles**: Use a neutral grip to grasp both handles with your palms facing each other.

#### Execution
1. **Initial Stance**: Step forward slightly to create tension in the cables. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Start Position**: Lift the handles to the sides with a slight bend in your elbows. Keep your arms parallel to the ground.
3. **Fly Motion**: Slowly pull the handles forward in an arc while squeezing your chest. Maintain the slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement.
4. **End Position**: Bring the handles together in front of your chest, without locking your elbows.
5. **Return**: Gradually reverse the motion, opening up your arms to return to the start position, resisting tension on the cables.

#### Tips for Proper Form
- **Maintain Posture**: Keep your chest up and shoulders back. Avoid rounding your back.
- **Control the Movement**: Focus on a slow and controlled motion, avoiding swinging or using momentum.
- **Breathing**: Exhale as you bring the handles together and inhale as you return to the start position.
- **Focus on the Chest**: Engage your pectoral muscles throughout the exercise to maximize effectiveness. 

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Locking the Elbows**: Keep a soft bend in your elbows at all times.
- **Using Too Much Weight**: Start light to master form before increasing resistance.
- **Arching the Back**: Maintain a neutral spine to prevent injury.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Cable Chest Fly effectively and safely.
