## Setup
1. **Start Position:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, kettlebell between your feet.
2. **Grip:** Hinge at your hips, bend your knees slightly, and grasp the kettlebell with one hand.

## Execution
1. **Hike the Kettlebell:** Pull the kettlebell back between your legs, keeping your arm straight.
2. **Explosive Lift:** In one motion, drive through your heels, extending your hips and knees. Swing the kettlebell forward.
3. **Pull and Rotate:** As the kettlebell rises, pull your elbow up and back while rotating your wrist so the kettlebell sits comfortably in the rack position on your forearm.
4. **Catch Position:** Allow your body to absorb the weight by slightly bending your knees and keeping your core engaged.

## Breathing
- Inhale as you prepare.
- Exhale explosively during the lift.

## Key Points
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout.
- Keep the kettlebell close to your body.
- Control the movement and avoid jerky motions.

## Common Mistakes
- **Overextending the Back:** Keep your back straight, avoiding excessive arching.
- **Rushing the Movement:** Focus on a controlled, smooth transition.
- **Not Engaging Core:** Ensure your core is tight to support your back and stabilize the movement.

By following these steps, you can perform the kettlebell hang clean with proper form, maximizing effectiveness while minimizing injury risk.
