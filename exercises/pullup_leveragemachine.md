## Setup
1. Adjust the leverage machine to your height.
2. Sit on the bench and grasp the pull-up handles or bar with an overhand grip.

## Starting Position
1. Position your feet on the footrest or platform.
2. Engage your core and keep your back straight.
3. Your arms should be fully extended, and shoulders should be relaxed.

## Execution
1. **Pull Down**: Engage your lats and pull the handles down towards your chest, bending your elbows at a 90-degree angle.
2. **Focus**: Keep your shoulders down and back during the pull.
3. **Control**: Move the handles smoothly; avoid jerking or using momentum.

## Finish
1. Lower the handles back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
2. Ensure your arms are fully extended at the bottom before beginning the next repetition.

## Key Points
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid leaning too far forward or backward.
- Keep your movements controlled to minimize strain on your shoulders.
