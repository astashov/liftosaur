---

## Setup
1. **Grip the Bar**: Use an overhand grip with hands wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. **Hang**: Let your body hang with arms fully extended, feet off the ground.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your body.
2. **Pull Up**: Drive your elbows down and back to pull your chest up towards the bar.
3. **Maintain Form**: Keep your shoulders down and avoid shrugging them up. Focus on using your back muscles.
4. **Reach the Top**: Aim for your chin to clear the bar or bring your chest to the bar.
5. **Lower Down**: Slowly lower your body back to the starting position with control.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Avoid Swinging**: Keep your body still; don't use momentum.
- **Breathing**: Exhale as you pull up and inhale while lowering down.
- **Use Full Range of Motion**: Fully extend your arms at the bottom and pull all the way up.

## Common Mistakes
- **Too Narrow Grip**: It reduces the effectiveness for lat involvement.
- **Inadequate Core Engagement**: Can lead to body swinging.
- **Partial Range**: Not completing the pull or the descent reduces effectiveness. 

Focus on keeping a steady pace and maintaining control throughout the movement.
