description: "Target hamstrings and lower back with the Leverage Machine Good Morning, using machine-guided resistance to practice the hip hinge safely and effectively."
---

## Setup
1. **Adjust the Machine:** Ensure the leverage machine is set to a suitable height for your body and that the weight is appropriate.
2. **Position Yourself:** Sit on the machine with your back against the pad and feet flat on the footplate. Your knees should be slightly bent.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core:** Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Start Position:** Grasp the handles or the machine's frame to maintain balance. Keep your back straight and chest up.
3. **Hip Hinge:** Slowly lower your torso forward by hinging at the hips. Maintain a neutral spine; do not round your back.
4. **Lowering Phase:** Go down until your upper body is nearly parallel to the ground or you feel a comfortable stretch in your hamstrings.
5. **Returning to Start:** Push through your hips to return to the starting position while keeping your back straight.

## Key Points
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you lower and inhale as you return to the starting position.
- **Avoid Excess Load:** Start with a lighter weight to master form before increasing resistance.
- **Range of Motion:** Ensure to control the motion without jerking or using momentum.

## Caution
- Only perform if you have a good foundation in hip hinging. Consult a trainer if unsure about your form.
