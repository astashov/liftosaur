## Equipment Needed
- Cable machine with a seated row attachment

## Starting Position
1. Adjust the seat height so your feet can comfortably rest on the platform.
2. Sit down, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
3. Grab the handle with both hands, palms facing each other or down.

## Execution
1. **Posture:** Sit upright with your back neutral and shoulders down. 
2. **Pulling Motion:**
   - Initiate the movement by drawing your elbows back, keeping them close to your body.
   - Pull the handle towards your lower ribcage while squeezing your shoulder blades together.
3. **End Position:** Your hands should be near your torso, elbows bent and in line with your body.
4. **Returning Phase:**
   - Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position while controlling the weight.
   - Do not lean back excessively or round your back during the return.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your feet flat and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Avoid using momentum; focus on a smooth, controlled motion.
- Ensure your head stays in a neutral position, looking forward, not upward or downward.
- Breathe out as you pull the handle in and breathe in as you return to the starting position.
