### Setup
1. **Adjust the Seat**: Position the seat so your elbows align with the pivot point of the machine.
2. **Foot Placement**: Place your feet firmly on the ground or the footrests. 

#### Starting Position
1. **Grip the Handles**: Grab the machine's handles with a neutral grip. Your elbows should be slightly bent and at shoulder height.
2. **Body Posture**: Sit upright with your back pressed against the seat backrest. 

#### Execution
1. **Lift**: Exhale as you slowly raise the handles outward and upward, keeping your elbows slightly bent. 
2. **Movement Path**: Ensure your arms follow a natural arc, moving laterally until your elbows are parallel to the ground. 
3. **Control**: Focus on contracting your shoulder muscles, primarily the deltoids, during the lift.

#### Lowering Phase
1. **Lower Slowly**: Inhale as you lower the handles back to the starting position, maintaining control.
2. **No Jerking**: Avoid using momentum; keep the movement smooth and deliberate.

#### Key Points
- **Avoid Arching**: Keep your back straight and avoid arching your spine.
- **Mind-Muscle Connection**: Focus on feeling the tension in your shoulders throughout the movement.
- **Breathe**: Maintain steady breathing; exhale on lift, inhale on lower.

#### Safety Tips
- **Know Your Limits**: Use a weight that challenges you without compromising form.
- **Regularly Check Form**: Ensure alignment of elbows and shoulders throughout the exercise to prevent injury.

By following these steps, you can effectively and safely perform the Leverage Machine Lateral Raise to target your shoulder muscles.
