## Equipment Needed
- Resistance band

## Setup
1. **Stand Tall**: Position yourself with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip the Band**: Step on the band with both feet to create tension, holding the ends of the band with an overhand grip (palms facing down).

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Begin with your arms fully extended at your sides, elbows close to your body.
2. **Curl Up**: Exhale and curl your hands towards your shoulders, keeping your elbows stationary. Focus on using your forearms to lift.
3. **Control the Movement**: Inhale as you lower your hands back to the starting position, maintaining tension in the band throughout the motion.

## Key Points
- **Posture**: Keep your back straight and core engaged to maintain stability.
- **Elbows**: Ensure elbows remain close to your torso throughout the exercise.
- **Focus**: Concentrate on the contraction of your forearm muscles during the curl.

## Common Mistakes
- **Using Momentum**: Avoid swinging your arms; the movement should be controlled.
- **Shoulder Movement**: Do not raise your shoulders; keep them relaxed and down.

## Tips
- Adjust the band length to modify resistance.
- Consider varying your grip width for different muscle engagement.
