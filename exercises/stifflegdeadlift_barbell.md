**Setup:**
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, barbell on the floor in front.
2. Bend at the hips, keeping legs straight but not locked, and grip the barbell with hands shoulder-width apart.

**Positioning:**
1. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
2. Shoulders should be slightly over the bar, and head in a neutral position.

**Execution:**
1. Hinge at the hips, lowering the barbell while keeping it close to your body.
2. Maintain a flat back and a slight bend in the knees.
3. Lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings—typically just below the knees.

**Return:**
1. Drive your hips forward to lift the barbell back up, straightening your torso.
2. Keep the bar path vertical along your legs and continue until you’re standing upright.

**Tips:**
- Do not round your back; maintain a neutral spine throughout.
- Focus on hinging at the hips rather than bending at the waist.
- Keep your feet flat on the ground throughout the movement.
