## Starting Position
1. **Setup the Cable Machine**: Attach a rope or straight bar to the high pulley of a cable machine.
2. **Adjust the Pulley**: Ensure the pulley is at the highest position.
3. **Stand or Sit Close**: Position yourself facing the machine, standing or sitting comfortably. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart.

## Grip and Arm Position
1. **Grip the Handle**: Grasp the rope or bar with both hands, palms facing each other (for rope) or facing down (for bar).
2. **Elbow Position**: Pull the handle down so your elbows are bent at about 90 degrees and tucked next to your body.

## Execution
1. **Start the Movement**: Engage your core and ensure your back is straight. 
2. **Extend the Arms**: Push the handle downwards by straightening your arms, keeping your elbows close to your torso.
3. **Full Extension**: Continue until your arms are fully extended without locking your elbows.

## Return Movement
1. **Controlled Return**: Slowly return to the starting position, keeping tension on the triceps.
2. **Avoid Swinging**: Maintain control and avoid using momentum; keep your elbows stationary.

## Common Mistakes
- **Flaring Elbows**: Ensure elbows stay close to the body throughout the movement.
- **Locking Elbows**: Avoid fully locking out your elbows to prevent injury.
- **Using Too Much Weight**: Focus on control rather than lifting heavier weights.

## Tips
- Keep your wrists in a neutral position.
- Maintain a slight bend in your knees for stability.
- Focus on the contraction of the triceps during the extension.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Cable Triceps Extension effectively and safely.
