### Setup
1. **Position the Bench**: Set an adjustable bench to a 30-45 degree incline and place it under the Smith machine bar.
2. **Load the Bar**: Add desired weights to the barbell in the Smith machine.

### Starting Position
1. **Lie Back**: Sit on the bench with your back against it and feet flat on the floor.
2. **Grip the Bar**: Grasp the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip. Your palms should face away from you.

### Execution
1. **Unrack the Bar**: Lift the bar off the hooks and position it over your chest.
2. **Lower the Bar**: Inhale as you lower the bar to your upper chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body.
3. **Press Up**: Exhale as you push the bar back to the starting position, extending your arms fully while keeping a slight bend in your elbows.

### Key Points
- Maintain a straight wrist and avoid flaring elbows excessively.
- Keep your shoulder blades retracted and pressed against the bench.
- Ensure your feet remain flat on the ground throughout the movement.
- Control both the lowering and pressing phases for safety and effectiveness.
