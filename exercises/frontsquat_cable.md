   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Shift your weight slightly back on your heels.

4. **Execution:**
   - Engage your core and maintain a straight back.
   - Begin the squat by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
   - Keep your chest up and elbows high throughout the movement.

5. **Depth:**
   - Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor or go deeper if comfortable.
   - Ensure your knees track over your toes.

   - Fully extend your hips and knees at the top without locking your knees.

#### Tips for Proper Form:
- Keep your chest lifted to prevent rounding of the back.
