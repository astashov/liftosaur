## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a squat rack, a barbell, and a sturdy box or bench.
2. **Box Height**: Choose a box height that allows your thighs to be parallel to the ground when seated.

## Starting Position
1. **Bar Placement**: Position the barbell on your upper traps.
2. **Grip**: Grab the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip.
3. **Foot Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider, toes pointing slightly outward.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
2. **Descent**:
   - Begin by pushing your hips back while bending your knees.
   - Lower your body in a controlled manner towards the box.
3. **Seated Position**:
   - Lightly touch the box with your glutes without bouncing.
   - Maintain an upright torso throughout the movement.
4. **Ascent**:
   - Push through your heels to stand back up.
   - Fully extend your hips and knees at the top.

## Key Points
- Keep your chest up and back straight.
- Ensure your knees do not cave in; they should track over your toes.
- Focus on a controlled movement throughout the exercise.

## Common Mistakes
- Bouncing off the box: Avoid using momentum to lift.
- Incorrect bar placement: Ensure it rests comfortably on your traps.
- Poor knee alignment: Prevent knees from caving inward.

By following this guide, you can perform the Barbell Box Squat safely and effectively.
