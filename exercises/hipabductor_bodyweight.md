### Starting Position
1. **Lie on your side**: Find a comfortable spot on a mat or soft surface.
2. **Align your body**: Keep your head, torso, legs, and feet in a straight line. Use your bottom arm for support and your top arm to stabilize yourself.

### Execution
1. **Engage your core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to maintain stability.
2. **Lift the top leg**: Slowly raise your top leg towards the ceiling while keeping it straight. Focus on using your hip muscles, not your lower back.
3. **Hold briefly**: Pause at the top of the movement for a moment.

### Lowering
1. **Return to start**: Slowly lower your top leg back to the starting position without letting it touch the bottom leg.

### Key Points
- **No swinging**: Avoid momentum; control the movement both up and down.
- **Foot position**: Keep your foot in a neutral position (flexed or pointed).
- **Maintain alignment**: Keep your hips stacked directly on top of each other throughout the movement.
