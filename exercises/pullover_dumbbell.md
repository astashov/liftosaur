## Starting Position
1. **Equipment**: Use a single dumbbell (or a pair, if preferred).
2. **Setup**: Lie on a flat bench horizontally, with your upper back and shoulders supported. Your feet should be flat on the ground.
3. **Grip**: Hold the dumbbell with both hands, either under the inner plate with your thumbs wrapped around the handle or by the arms of the dumbbell.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Extend your arms straight above your chest with a slight bend in your elbows.
2. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell in an arc behind your head, keeping your elbows fixed in a slight bend.
   - Engage your core and maintain a steady back.
3. **Range of Motion**: Lower until you feel a gentle stretch in your chest and lats, typically until your arms are parallel to the ground or slightly lower.
4. **Lifting Phase**:
   - Exhale and reverse the motion by pulling the dumbbell back over your chest using your lats and chest muscles.
   - Aim to keep your movements fluid and controlled throughout the exercise.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Elbow Position**: Keep your elbows slightly bent but do not flare them out too wide.
- **Back Position**: Maintain a neutral spine; do not arch your back excessively.
- **Breathing**: Inhale while lowering the dumbbell and exhale while raising it.
- **Weight Control**: Start with a lighter weight to master form before progressing to heavier weights.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing the back to arch excessively.
- Flaring elbows too wide during the movement.
- Using momentum instead of muscle control.

By following these instructions, you can effectively perform the Dumbbell Pullover with proper form.
