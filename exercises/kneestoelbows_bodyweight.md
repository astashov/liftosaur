### Setup
1. **Starting Position**: Hang from a pull-up bar with a shoulder-width grip, arms fully extended, legs straight down.

### Execution
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body.
3. **Lift Legs**: Bend your knees and lift them towards your elbows, driving your knees upward. 
4. **Aim for Elbows**: Bring your knees as high as possible, ideally touching your elbows or getting close.
5. **Controlled Descent**: Lower your legs back to the starting position in a controlled manner, avoiding swinging.

### Key Points
- Maintain a slight bend in your elbows throughout.
- Keep your body straight and avoid excessive swinging.
- Breathe out as you raise your knees and inhale as you lower them.
- Focus on engaging your core for maximum effectiveness. 

### Common Mistakes
- Swinging legs instead of using core muscles.
- Not lifting knees high enough.
- Letting shoulders shrug up towards ears – keep them relaxed. 

By following these instructions, you'll ensure that you're performing Bodyweight Knees to Elbows with proper form, maximizing benefits while minimizing the risk of injury.
