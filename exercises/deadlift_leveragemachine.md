## Setup
1. **Adjust Machine:** Set the lever arm to an appropriate height, so you can start with your knees slightly bent and feet flat on the platform.
2. **Foot Position:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, flat against the footplate.

## Grip
1. **Hand Placement:** Grab the handles or bar with both hands, using a neutral (palms facing each other) or overhand grip, depending on the machine design.

## Starting Position
1. **Back Position:** Keep your back straight and chest up. Engage your core to stabilize your spine.
2. **Knees and Hips:** Position your knees just behind your toes; hips should be lower than your shoulders.

## Execution
1. **Initiate the Lift:** Push through your heels, extending your knees and hips simultaneously.
2. **Maintain Form:** Keep the weights close to your body as you rise. Avoid rounding your back or leaning too far forward.
3. **Full Extension:** Stand upright at the top of the movement, ensuring your shoulders are back and down.

## Lowering the Weight
1. **Control the Descent:** Hinge at your hips first, then bend your knees while keeping your back straight.
2. **Return to Start:** Lower the weight back to the starting position in a controlled manner, avoiding sudden drops or jerks.

## Tips
- **Breathing:** Inhale before the lift and exhale at the top. 
- **Focus on Form:** Prioritize proper technique over lifting heavy weights to prevent injury.
- **Avoid Overextension:** Do not hyperextend your back at the top of the lift. 

Always consult with a professional trainer if you're unsure about your form or the equipment.
