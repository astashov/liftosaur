### Setup:
1. **Bench Position**: Set an incline bench at a 30 to 45-degree angle.
2. **Dumbbells**: Place a dumbbell on either side of the bench.

### Execution:
1. **Body Position**:
   - Lie face down on the bench with your chest against it.
   - Keep your feet flat on the floor or on the bench for stability.
   - Allow your arms to hang straight down, holding a dumbbell in each hand.

2. **Grip**: Use a neutral grip (palms facing each other) or an overhand grip (palms facing towards you).

3. **Rowing Motion**:
   - Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back.
   - As you exhale, pull the dumbbells towards your torso, keeping your elbows close to your body.
   - Aim to bring the dumbbells to the lower rib area or your waist.

4. **Controlled Descent**:
   - Inhale as you lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
   - Maintain control, avoiding letting the weights drop quickly.

### Tips:
- **Alignment**: Keep your head, neck, and spine aligned throughout the movement.
- **Tempo**: Focus on a steady and controlled tempo, both when pulling and lowering the weights.
- **Focus on Back Muscles**: Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement, emphasizing the engagement of the back muscles.

### Common Mistakes:
- Lifting too heavy, leading to poor form and potential injury.
- Allowing the back to arch or the shoulders to rise excessively during the row.
- Using momentum instead of controlled strength to lift the weights.
