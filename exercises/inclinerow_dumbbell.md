### Setup:
1. **Bench Position**: Set an incline bench at a 30 to 45-degree angle.
2. **Dumbbells**: Place a dumbbell on either side of the bench.

### Execution:
1. **Body Position**:
   - Lie face down on the bench with your chest against it.
   - Keep your feet flat on the floor or on the bench for stability.
   - Allow your arms to hang straight down, holding a dumbbell in each hand.

2. **Grip**: Use a neutral grip (palms facing each other) or an overhand grip (palms facing towards you).

3. **Rowing Motion**:
   - Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back.
   - As you exhale, pull the dumbbells towards your torso, keeping your elbows close to your body.
   - Aim to bring the dumbbells to the lower rib area or your waist.

4. **Controlled Descent**:
   - Inhale as you lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
   - Maintain control, avoiding letting the weights drop quickly.

### Tips:
- **Alignment**: Keep your head, neck, and spine aligned throughout the movement.
- **Tempo**: Focus on a steady and controlled tempo, both when pulling and lowering the weights.
- **Focus on Back Muscles**: Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement, emphasizing the engagement of the back muscles.

### Common Mistakes:
- Lifting too heavy, leading to poor form and potential injury.
- Allowing the back to arch or the shoulders to rise excessively during the row.
- Using momentum instead of controlled strength to lift the weights.

Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back. Exhale and row the dumbbells toward your lower ribcage, keeping elbows close to your body.

### Squeeze at the Top
Hold briefly at the top of the movement and squeeze your shoulder blades together to maximize back engagement.

### Lower with Control
Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. Maintain control and avoid dropping the weights or using momentum.
