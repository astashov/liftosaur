**Starting Position:**
1. Stand upright with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grip a barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down), hands shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your arms extended down in front of you, elbows close to your body.

**Execution:**
1. Engage your core and keep your back straight.
2. Flex your elbows to lift the barbell towards your chest, maintaining the overhand grip.
3. Keep your upper arms stationary throughout the movement.
4. Focus on using your forearms to lift the weight.

**At the Top:**
1. Reach the barbell close to your chest, holding for a brief moment.
2. Ensure your wrists remain neutral, not bending excessively.

**Return:**
1. Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
2. Maintain control throughout the descent to prevent swinging.

**Tips:**
- Avoid using momentum; the movement should be smooth and controlled.
- Keep your elbows close to your body to engage the correct muscles effectively.
- Breathe in during the lowering phase and exhale while lifting.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Allowing the elbows to flare out.
- Using too much weight, which can compromise form.
- Rounding the back; maintain a straight posture.
