## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a reverse hyperextension bench or a stable surface. Attach a resistance band securely.
2. **Position**: Lie face down on the bench with your hips at the edge and legs hanging off. Hook the resistance band around your feet.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position**: Keep your legs together and body straight, with your head in a neutral position.
2. **Movement**:
   - Engage your core and glutes.
   - Lift your legs upward towards the ceiling, hinging at the hips.
   - Aim to raise your legs until your body forms a straight line from head to toes.
3. **Pause**: Hold the top position for a brief second to maximize contraction.
4. **Lowering**: Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

## Tips
- Keep movements slow and controlled to focus on muscle engagement.
- Avoid arching your back; keep your hips stable.
- Adjust tension by modifying the band's resistance. 

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting legs too high and compensating with the back.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.

By following these steps, you can effectively perform the Band Reverse Hyperextension with proper form, targeting your glutes and lower back safely.
