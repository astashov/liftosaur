## Starting Position
- Stand facing a sturdy platform or bench, feet hip-width apart.

## Execution
1. **Step Up**: Place one foot firmly on the platform. Keep your weight on that leg.
2. **Drive Up**: Push through the heel of the elevated foot, straightening your leg to lift your body onto the platform.
3. **Thermal Leg**: Bring the opposite knee up towards your chest as you step up.
4. **Lower Down**: Step down carefully with the same foot you used to step up, controlling the descent.
5. **Repeat**: Alternate legs and continue the movement.

## Form Tips

## Common Mistakes

- Not engaging the core or using poor posture.

By following these steps, you will perform the bodyweight step up safely and effectively.
