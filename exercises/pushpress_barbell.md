### Equipment Needed
- Barbell
- Weight plates (optional)
- Squat rack or lifting platform

### Starting Position
1. **Grip**: Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width.
2. **Positioning**: Rest the barbell on your upper chest, with forearms perpendicular to the ground, and elbows slightly in front of the bar.
3. **Feet**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in your knees.

### Execution
1. **Dip**: Slightly bend your knees and lower your torso, keeping your chest up and back straight. This is a brief dip.
2. **Drive**: Quickly extend your knees while simultaneously pushing through your heels and pressing the barbell overhead. Engage your core for stability.
3. **Lockout**: Fully extend your arms at the top, keeping the bar directly over your head. Your body should form a straight line from your wrists to your ankles.
4. **Lowering**: Carefully lower the barbell back to the starting position on your upper chest. Ensure it’s under control.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your core tight throughout the movement.
- Ensure your wrists are straight and elbows are pointed slightly forward.
- Avoid leaning back excessively; maintain a neutral spine.
- Breathe out while pressing up and inhale as you lower the barbell.

### Safety
- Use a spotter if lifting heavy weight.
- Ensure weights are securely fastened on the bar.
- Perform the exercise in a controlled manner to prevent injury.
