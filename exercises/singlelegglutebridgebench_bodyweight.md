## Setup
1. **Identify a Bench:** Find a stable bench or elevated surface.
2. **Position Yourself:** Sit on the ground in front of the bench, and place your upper back against the edge of the bench.

## Execution
1. **Foot Placement:** Extend one leg straight ahead. Place the heel of the other foot on the bench.
2. **Hand Position:** Keep your arms at your sides for stability or place them on your hips.
3. **Engage Core:** Tighten your abdominal muscles to maintain stability.
4. **Lift Hips:** Press through the heel on the bench while lifting your hips upward. Your shoulders, hips, and knee should form a straight line at the top.
5. **Hold This Position:** Briefly pause at the top for maximum glute engagement.
6. **Return to Start:** Lower your hips back down until your glutes touch the floor. Maintain control during the descent.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Alignment:** Keep your knee aligned with your ankle and not let it collapse inward.
- **Keep Your Core Tight:** This helps in maintaining balance and stability.
- **Focus on the Glutes:** Ensure the motion is driven by your glutes, not your lower back.
- **Breathing:** Inhale as you lower down and exhale as you lift up.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not fully extending the lifted leg.
- Letting the hips sag or overextend during the movement.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.

By following these steps, you'll effectively target your glutes while improving balance and stability.

### Set Up at the Bench
Sit on the ground in front of a stable bench and place your upper back against its edge. Extend one leg straight ahead and place the heel of the other foot on the bench.

### Engage and Lift
Tighten your core and press through the heel on the bench to drive your hips upward. Your shoulders, hips, and knee should form a straight line at the top.

### Pause and Squeeze
Hold briefly at the top, squeezing the glute of the working leg for maximum activation.

### Lower with Control
Return your hips toward the floor in a controlled descent, maintaining tension in your core. Avoid using momentum and keep your knee aligned with your ankle throughout.
