### Setup
1. **Adjust Seat Height**: Sit on the leverage machine and adjust the seat so that your arms are parallel to the ground when grasping the handles.
2. **Position Yourself**: Your back should be flat against the backrest, with feet flat on the ground.

### Starting Position
1. **Grip Handles**: Hold the handles with an overhand grip, arms extended straight in front of you.
2. **Elbows Slightly Bent**: Your elbows should have a slight bend to reduce strain on the joints.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles for stability throughout the movement.
2. **Pull Back**: Slowly pull the handles outward and back in a controlled motion, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together.
3. **Maintain Elbow Position**: Keep your elbows at shoulder height or slightly above throughout the movement.
4. **Avoid Momentum**: Do not use your body or momentum to swing the weights; the movement should be smooth.

### Return
1. **Control the Weight**: Return to the starting position in a controlled manner, avoiding any sudden movements.
2. **Repeat**: Continue as prescribed while maintaining focus on form.

### Key Points
- **Shoulder Alignment**: Keep your shoulders down and avoid shrugging them upward.
- **Breathing**: Exhale during the pulling phase and inhale while returning to the starting position.
- **Focus on Muscles**: Emphasize the contraction in your posterior deltoids and upper back.

### Safety Tips
- Avoid overextending your arms.
- Ensure your movements are smooth to prevent any strain.
