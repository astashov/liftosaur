### Starting Position
1. **Seating**: Sit on a bench or chair with your feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart.
2. **Dumbbell Grip**: Hold a dumbbell in one hand.
3. **Arm Position**: Rest the elbow of the working arm on the inside of your thigh for stability.

### Execution
1. **Start Curl**: With a controlled motion, curl the dumbbell upwards. Focus on contracting your bicep.
2. **Elbow Alignment**: Keep your elbow close to your body and stationary; only the forearm should move.
3. **Peak Contraction**: At the top of the curl, squeeze your bicep briefly.
4. **Lowering Phase**: Lower the dumbbell back down slowly to the starting position, maintaining control throughout.

### Breathing

- Exhale during the upward curl.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral wrist throughout the movement.
- Avoid swinging or using momentum; focus on isolating the bicep.
- Remember to switch arms after completing your repetitions.
