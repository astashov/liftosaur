### Setup
1. **Positioning**: Lie on the bench under the Smith machine. Your eyes should be directly under the bar.
2. **Feet**: Plant your feet firmly on the ground, shoulder-width apart.
3. **Grip**: Grab the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.

#### Execution
1. **Unrack the Bar**: Lift the bar off the hooks by pushing straight up. Lock your arms out.
2. **Lowering Phase**: Inhale and slowly lower the bar to your chest. Keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
3. **Pressing Phase**: Exhale and push the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms. Keep your back flat against the bench.

#### Key Points
- **Shoulder Position**: Keep your shoulders retracted and down throughout the movement.
- **Wrist Alignment**: Maintain a neutral wrist position, avoiding excessive bending.
- **Movement Control**: Focus on a smooth and controlled motion to reduce injury risk.
- **Spotter**: If you're lifting heavy weights, use a spotter for safety.

#### Safety Tips
- Always check that the Smith machine is set up correctly.
- Never bounce the bar off your chest.
- Start with lighter weights until you master the form.
