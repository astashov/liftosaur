3. **Squat**:
   - Push your hips back and bend your knees, lowering your body into a squat.
   - Ensure your knees track over your toes.

4. **Row**:
   - As you rise from the squat, pull the band towards your torso, keeping your elbows close to your body.
   - Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the row.

5. **Return**:
   - Lower the band back to the starting position as you descend back into the squat.
   - Maintain control and avoid jerky movements.
