---

### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band with appropriate tension.
2. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand upright with feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Hold the band with one hand, securing the other end under your foot on the same side.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles.
2. **Side Bend**:
   - Slowly lean to the side, bringing your hand down towards your knee.
   - Keep your opposite arm extended overhead for balance.
3. **Return to Start**:
   - Engage your obliques and return to the upright position.
   - Avoid leaning back or forth excessively; focus on lateral movement.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid locking your knees; keep them slightly bent.
- Perform the exercise in a controlled manner, emphasizing the stretch.
- Switch sides to work both obliques. 

### Common Mistakes
- Overextending the lower back.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.
- Not keeping the hips stable during the bend.

### Set Up the Band
Stand upright with feet shoulder-width apart. Step on one end of the band with your foot and hold the other end in the same-side hand.

### Engage and Bend
Tighten your abdominal muscles, then slowly lean to the side, bringing your hand down toward your knee. Keep your hips stable and avoid leaning forward or backward.

### Return to Upright
Engage your obliques to pull yourself back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Avoid using momentum to return.

### Switch Sides
Complete all reps on one side, then switch the band to the other hand and foot to work the opposite oblique.
