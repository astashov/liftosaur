### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band with appropriate tension.
2. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand upright with feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Hold the band with one hand, securing the other end under your foot on the same side.

### Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles.
2. **Side Bend**:
   - Slowly lean to the side, bringing your hand down towards your knee.
   - Keep your opposite arm extended overhead for balance.
3. **Return to Start**:
   - Engage your obliques and return to the upright position.
   - Avoid leaning back or forth excessively; focus on lateral movement.

### Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
- Avoid locking your knees; keep them slightly bent.
- Perform the exercise in a controlled manner, emphasizing the stretch.
- Switch sides to work both obliques. 

### Common Mistakes
- Overextending the lower back.
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement.
- Not keeping the hips stable during the bend.
