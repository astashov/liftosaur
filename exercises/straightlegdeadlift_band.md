## Equipment Needed
- Resistance band

## Setup
1. **Position Band**: Stand on the center of the band with feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip**: Hold the ends of the band with both hands, arms fully extended down in front of you.

## Starting Position
- Stand upright with a slight bend in your knees and shoulders back. Engage your core.

## Execution
1. **Hinge at the Hips**: Push your hips back while keeping your back straight. Keep your chest up.
2. **Lower the Band**: Gradually bend at the hips until your torso is parallel to the ground, allowing the band to pull downward.
3. **Maintain Tension**: Keep the band taut throughout the movement to engage your hamstrings and glutes.
4. **Return to Start**: Reverse the motion by driving your hips forward, bringing your torso back to the upright position.

## Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your spine neutral; avoid rounding your back.
- Ensure your knees remain slightly bent; do not lock them.
- Focus on feeling a stretch in your hamstrings during the lowering phase.
- Move slowly and with control to maintain tension.

## Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back instead of maintaining a straight spine.
- Overextending or locking the knees.
- Using too much momentum rather than controlled movement.

By following these steps, you'll effectively target your hamstrings and glutes while maintaining proper form during the Band Straight Leg Deadlift.
