## Setup
1. **Position Yourself:** Sit on the seated leg press with your back firmly against the pad. Adjust the seat so that your feet can be placed comfortably on the platform.
2. **Foot Placement:** Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, focusing on the balls of your feet. Your heels should hang off the edge.

## Execution
1. **Starting Position:** Push the platform slightly to ensure the machine is locked in position.
2. **Calf Raise:** Flex your ankles by pressing through the balls of your feet, lifting your heels as high as possible while keeping your knees straight.
3. **Range of Motion:** Lower your heels back down towards the platform to achieve a full stretch in your calves without letting them rest completely.
4. **Breathing:** Exhale as you lift your heels and inhale as you lower.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Controlled Movement:** Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled movements throughout the exercise.
- **Avoid Locking Knees:** Keep a slight bend in your knees to prevent strain.
- **Foot Position:** Experiment with foot positioning (toes pointed in, out, or straight) to target different parts of the calf muscles.
- **Stay Engaged:** Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise for stability.

## Common Mistakes 
- **Too Much Weight:** Start with a manageable weight to maintain control and form.
- **Partial Range of Motion:** Ensure you achieve a full range of motion for effective calf training.
- **Rounding Back:** Maintain good posture with an upright torso throughout the exercise. 

## Conclusion
Incorporate the Leverage Machine Calf Press into your routine for effective calf development, remembering to focus on form over weight.
