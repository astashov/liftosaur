### Equipment Needed
- Cable machine with a close grip attachment.

### Setup
1. **Adjust the Cable**: Set the pulley to a lower position.
2. **Select Weight**: Choose an appropriate weight for your strength level.
3. **Stand in Front**: Position yourself facing the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart.

### Starting Position
1. **Grip the Handle**: Use a close grip attachment and grasp it with both hands, palms facing each other.
2. **Position Your Body**: Slightly bend your knees and hinge at your hips, keeping your back straight and chest up.
3. **Create Tension**: Step back slightly to create tension in the cable.

### Execution
1. **Pull the Handle**: Exhale as you pull the handle towards your torso, keeping your elbows close to your body.
2. **Squeeze the Back**: Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the peak of the movement.
3. **Controlled Return**: Inhale as you slowly extend your arms back to the starting position while maintaining control.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise.
- Avoid leaning back or using momentum; the movement should be smooth and controlled.
- Maintain a neutral spine—don’t round your back.
- Ensure your shoulders stay down and relaxed.

### Common Mistakes
