### Starting Position
1. Lie flat on your back on a mat.
2. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
3. Position your arms at your sides or behind your head with elbows bent.

### Execution
1. Engage your core. 
2. Lift your head, shoulders, and upper back off the ground.
3. Bring your right elbow towards your left knee while simultaneously extending your right leg out straight.
4. Hold for a moment at the top of the movement.
5. Lower back down to the starting position with control.
6. Repeat on the opposite side, bringing your left elbow towards your right knee.

### Tips for Proper Form
- Keep your lower back pressed into the mat to avoid straining.
- Move in a controlled manner; avoid jerky movements.
- Focus on using your abdominal muscles to lift, not your neck or back.
- Breathe out as you crunch up and inhale as you lower down.

### Common Mistakes
- Pulling on the neck: Keep hands lightly supporting the head without yanking.
- Rounding the lower back: Maintain a neutral spine as much as possible.
- Incomplete range of motion: Ensure you lift your shoulder blades off the ground.

By following these guidelines, you can perform the Bodyweight Cross Body Crunch effectively to target your core.
