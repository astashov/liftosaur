---

## Starting Position
1. **Seating**: Sit on a bench with back support, feet flat on the ground.
2. **Grip**: Hold a barbell with both hands, palms facing down, slightly wider than shoulder width.

## Execution
1. **Preparation**: Start with the barbell resting on your thighs.
2. **Lift**: Engage your core and raise the barbell in front of you.
3. **Alignment**: Keep your arms straight but not locked, and lift the barbell to shoulder height.
4. **Control**: Lower the barbell back to the starting position with control.

## Key Points
- **Posture**: Maintain a straight back and avoid leaning back.
- **Movement**: Focus on using your shoulders; avoid using momentum.
- **Breathing**: Exhale while lifting and inhale while lowering the barbell.

## Common Mistakes
- Lifting with the lower back instead of the shoulders.
- Using too much weight, which can compromise form.
- Allowing movement in the elbows; keep them slightly bent.
