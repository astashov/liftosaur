### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a resistance band and a flat surface or mat.
2. **Anchor Band**: Secure one end of the resistance band to a stable object, ensuring it's anchored low to the ground.
3. **Positioning**: Lie face down on the mat, with the anchored band behind your ankles.

### Execution
1. **Initial Position**: Keep your legs extended straight behind you, with your knees aligned and your hips pressed into the mat.
2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your body.
3. **Curl Motion**: Flex your knees to bring your heels towards your glutes. Keep your hips down and avoid lifting your torso.
4. **Peak Contraction**: Hold the contraction momentarily when your heels are near your glutes.
5. **Lowering Phase**: Slowly extend your legs back to the starting position, maintaining control and tension in the band.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Breathing**: Exhale during the curl and inhale while extending.
- **Avoid Jerking**: Move smoothly to prevent injury.
- **Focus**: Concentrate on using your hamstrings to control the movement.

### Common Mistakes
- Lifting hips off the mat.
- Using momentum rather than muscle strength.
- Allowing the band to go slack during the exercise. 

By following these steps, you can perform the Band Lying Leg Curl effectively and safely.
