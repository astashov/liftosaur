### Setup
1. **Find a Bar**: Use a pull-up bar or any sturdy horizontal bar that can support your weight.
2. **Grip the Bar**: Hang from the bar with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart. Ensure your arms are fully extended.

### Execution
1. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles before starting the movement.
2. **Raise Your Legs**: Keeping your legs straight, lift them in front of you. Aim to bring your legs parallel to the ground or higher.
3. **Pause at the Top**: Hold the position for a moment to maximize tension in your core.
4. **Lower your Legs**: Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position while maintaining control.

### Tips for Proper Form
- **Avoid Swinging**: Keep your movements slow and controlled to prevent using momentum.
- **Modify if Necessary**: If straight legs are too challenging, bend your knees and bring them towards your chest.
- **Breathing**: Exhale as you lift your legs and inhale as you lower them.

### Common Mistakes
- **Bringing Legs Too Low**: Avoid lowering your legs too quickly or dropping them without control.
- **Poor Grip**: Ensure you maintain a firm grip on the bar to prevent slipping.

### Safety
- **Warm-Up**: Perform a gentle warm-up before this exercise to prepare your muscles.
- **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience pain, stop and reassess your form or consult a professional.
