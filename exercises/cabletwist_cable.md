## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a low pulley.
2. **Attachment**: Attach a handle to the cable.

## Starting Position
1. **Adjustment**: Stand beside the cable machine, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip**: Grab the handle with both hands, arms extended in front of you.
3. **Body Position**: Stand perpendicular to the cable, with your side facing the machine.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your torso.
2. **Twist**: Rotate your torso away from the cable, pulling the handle across your body.
3. **Controlled Movement**: Keep your arms straight, but not locked, as you twist your torso.
4. **Return**: Reverse the motion in a controlled manner, returning to the starting position.

## Tips
- **Knees Slightly Bent**: Maintain a slight bend in your knees to absorb tension.
- **Avoid Overextending**: Do not hyperextend your arms or back during the twist.
- **Focus on Movement**: Ensure the twist comes from your core, not just your arms. 

## Breathing
- **Inhale** on the return.
- **Exhale** as you twist away from the cable.

## Common Mistakes
- Twisting hips instead of the core.
- Using momentum instead of controlled strength.

Maintain proper form to maximize effectiveness and reduce risk of injury.
