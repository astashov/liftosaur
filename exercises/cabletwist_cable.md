---

## Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a cable machine with a low pulley.
2. **Attachment**: Attach a handle to the cable.

## Starting Position
1. **Adjustment**: Stand beside the cable machine, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Grip**: Grab the handle with both hands, arms extended in front of you.
3. **Body Position**: Stand perpendicular to the cable, with your side facing the machine.

## Execution
1. **Engage Core**: Tighten your core to stabilize your torso.
2. **Twist**: Rotate your torso away from the cable, pulling the handle across your body.
3. **Controlled Movement**: Keep your arms straight, but not locked, as you twist your torso.
4. **Return**: Reverse the motion in a controlled manner, returning to the starting position.

## Tips
- **Knees Slightly Bent**: Maintain a slight bend in your knees to absorb tension.
- **Avoid Overextending**: Do not hyperextend your arms or back during the twist.
- **Focus on Movement**: Ensure the twist comes from your core, not just your arms.

## Breathing
- **Inhale** on the return.
- **Exhale** as you twist away from the cable.

## Common Mistakes
- Twisting hips instead of the core.
- Using momentum instead of controlled strength.

Maintain proper form to maximize effectiveness and reduce risk of injury.

### Set Up and Stand Perpendicular
Attach a handle to the low cable pulley. Stand with your side facing the machine, feet shoulder-width apart, and hold the handle with both hands and arms extended.

### Engage Core Before Twisting
Tighten your core and maintain a slight knee bend. Keep your hips stable and facing forward before beginning the rotation.

### Rotate Away from the Cable
Twist your torso away from the cable machine, pulling the handle across your body with arms straight but not locked. Drive the motion from your core rather than your arms.

### Return with Control
Reverse the rotation back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Inhale on the return and exhale as you twist away.
