## Equipment Needed
- Resistance band
- Pull-up bar

## Steps

1. **Setup the Band**: Loop a resistance band over the pull-up bar, ensuring it’s secure. Adjust the band for the right height based on your body size.

2. **Position Yourself**: Stand facing the bar. Grab the bar with an overhand grip (palms away) slightly wider than shoulder-width.

3. **Kneel in the Band**: Place one knee or foot into the loop of the band. Ensure your leg is securely tucked in to avoid slipping.

4. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core and maintain a straight body alignment from head to heels.

5. **Hang with Control**: Start in a dead hang, allowing your arms to fully extend. Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears.

6. **Pull Up**: Initiate the movement by pulling your elbows down and back. Focus on using your back muscles rather than just your arms.

7. **Chin Over Bar**: Continue to pull until your chin is above the bar. Keep your body close to the bar throughout the movement.

8. **Lower Down Slowly**: Reverse the movement in a controlled manner, fully extending your arms back to the dead hang position.

## Tips
- Maintain a neutral spine; avoid swinging or using momentum.
- Keep your shoulders engaged and avoid shrugging them up.
- Breathe out as you pull up, inhale as you lower.

## Common Mistakes
- Using too much momentum.
- Flared elbows or shoulders.
- Not maintaining a straight body line.
