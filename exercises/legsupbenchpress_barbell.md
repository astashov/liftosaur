### Setup
1. **Equipment**: Use a flat bench and a barbell.
2. **Position Yourself**: Lie on your back on the bench, ensuring your head, shoulders, and buttocks are in contact with it.
3. **Leg Position**: Lift your legs straight up towards the ceiling, keeping them together. Your legs should be at a 90-degree angle to the floor.

### Grip

2. **Barbell Position**: Position the barbell over your chest with your arms fully extended.

### Execution
1. **Lowering Phase**:
   - Inhale and lower the barbell slowly towards your chest, maintaining control.
   - Keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body.

2. **Pressing Phase**:
   - Exhale and press the barbell back up to the starting position.
   - Ensure the barbell moves in a straight line, staying directly above your chest.

### Form Tips
- **Core Engagement**: Keep your core tight to stabilize your body.
- **Leg Position**: Avoid bending your knees; keep legs straight and vertical.
- **Wrist Position**: Maintain a neutral wrist position, avoiding excessive bending.

### Common Mistakes
- Allowing hips to lift off the bench.

- Maintain a consistent breathing pattern.
- Ensure a smooth and deliberate motion for both lowering and pressing phases.
