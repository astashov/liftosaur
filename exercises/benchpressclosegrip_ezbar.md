## Starting Position
1. **Setup**: Lie on a flat bench with your feet flat on the floor.
2. **Grip**: Use an EZ bar with a close grip (inside the angled parts of the bar). Your hands should be shoulder-width apart or slightly closer.
3. **Bar Placement**: Position the bar above your chest, arms fully extended. 

## Execution
1. **Lowering**: Inhale, lower the bar slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked close to your body.
2. **Pause**: Hold the bar just above your chest for a brief moment.
3. **Pressing**: Exhale, press the bar back up in a straight line until your arms are fully extended without locking your elbows.

## Tips for Proper Form
- **Wrist Position**: Keep wrists straight and aligned with your forearms throughout the movement.
- **Back Position**: Maintain a natural arch in your back without excessive lifting.
- **Core Engagement**: Engage your core to provide stability during the press.
- **Focus**: Keep your gaze upwards to maintain a neutral neck position.

## Safety Considerations
- Use a spotter or safety bars if lifting heavy.
- Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest.

By following these steps, you can effectively perform the EZ Bar Bench Press with a close grip, targeting the triceps and inner chest muscles.
