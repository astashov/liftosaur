    <h1>Liftosaur Privacy Policy for Health Connect Integration</h1>
    <p>
      Our app integrates with Health Connect to access and store specific health-related data, including body weight and
      body fat percentage. You can track your body weight and body fat in the app. If you go to Me -> Measurements,
      you'll be able to enter your body weight and body fat there, and it may be synced to Health Connect. The app also can
      sync that data from Health Connect to display inside of the app. Here's how we handle this data:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      We collect Health Connect data through the Health Connect integration to enhance the app's
      functionality. This data is used solely for tracking and providing insights within the app.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
      The collected data is stored locally on your device and in the cloud on our servers. We implement strict
      security measures to protect this data from unauthorized access, ensuring it is stored safely and securely.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Data Usage</h3>

      within the app for your use.
    </p>

    <h3>5. User Control</h3>
    <p>
      You retain control over your data. You can choose to delete or update your body weight and body fat data at any
      time within the app. If you wish to delete your data stored on our servers, you can do that through the app's
      settings (Me -> Account -> Delete Current Cloud Account)</a>.
