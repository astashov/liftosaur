            Check the interactive playground below to see how the program works, and what the weights/sets/reps look
            like for each week. You can edit the 2RM, 5RM, etc weights for each exercise, and see how the weight
            changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can run GZCL: General Gainz - Burrito But Big program in the Liftosaur app. You only would need to set
            initial RM weights for each exercise, and the app will automatically calculate the weights, change the sets,
            autobalance the T3 weights, and do all the math for you.
