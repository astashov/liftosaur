          <h2>Application of the GZCL Principle to the General Gainz program</h2>
          <h3>T1 Exercises</h3>
          <p>The progression is based on 4 actions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Find</strong>: you pick a weight you can do for 3-6 reps (3RM-6RM), make an attempt, and estimate
              it's complexity. Whether it was easy (RPE 8 - 2 reps in the tank), medium (RPE 9 - 1 rep in the tank), or
              hard - (RPE 10 - no reps in the tank).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hold</strong>: next time you try to do the <strong>same reps with same weight</strong> (e.g., for
              a second chance).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Push</strong>: next time you try to do <strong>more reps with same weight</strong>, push your
              limits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extend</strong>: Do <strong>1-rep sets</strong> after the first 3-6 RM set. The number of sets
              matches your first RM set. For example, if you did a 5RM, you do 5 additional 1-rep sets with the same
              weight. You can extend the number of sets up to an additional 3 sets if the first set was easy or medium.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So, initially you do <strong>Find</strong> and <strong>Extend</strong>. In the next workouts, you make a
            decision - either <strong>Hold</strong> or <strong>Push</strong>, and after that - <strong>Extend</strong>{" "}
            again.
          </p>
          <p>Once you get to 6RM + 6 sets, you can increase the weight.</p>
          <p>
            Rest time is important; otherwise, you can pretty much do the extension sets forever. <strong>3-5</strong>{" "}
            minutes after first set, and <strong>2-3</strong> minutes after extension sets.
          </p>
          <h3>T2 Exercises</h3>
          <p>Pretty similar to T1 - also have 4 actions with the same meaning:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Find</strong>: you pick a weight you can do for 6-10 reps (6RM-10RM), make an attempt, and
              estimate it's complexity. Whether it was easy (RPE 8 - 2 reps in the tank), medium (RPE 9 - 1 rep in the
              tank) or hard - (RPE 10 - no reps in the tank).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hold</strong>: next time you try to do the <strong>same reps with same weight</strong> (e.g., for
              a second chance).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Push</strong>: next time you try to do <strong>more reps with same weight</strong>, push your
              limits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extend</strong>: Do <strong>half-sets</strong> after the first 6-10 RM set. Your goal is to get 2
              times of the reps from the first set, doing sets with half reps of your first set. For example if you did
              10RM first set, you want to get <strong>20 reps</strong> total in the extension sets. So, you do{" "}
              <strong>4 sets of 5 reps</strong> (5 = 10 / 2). You can extend the number of sets up to an additional{" "}
              <strong>2 sets</strong> if the first set was easy or medium.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you get to 10RM + all extension sets, you can increase the weight.</p>
          <p>
            Rest time is important here too. Rest for <strong>2-4</strong> minutes after the first set, and{" "}
            <strong>1-2</strong> minutes after extension sets.
          </p>
          <h3>T3 Exercises</h3>
          <p>
            T3 exercises consist of just 3 sets of AMRAP (or Max Rep Sets - MRS). Keep short rest times between them -{" "}
            <strong>30-90 seconds</strong>.
          </p>
