            . The GZCL name comes from his Reddit username -{" "}

            . It's a 12-week weightlifting program, following GZCL principles, and offering quite a lot of volume. It's
            both for hypertrophy and strength. It starts with lower intensity / higher volume, and progresses to higher
            intensity / lower volume. It's a fun program to run, offering somewhat unusual and interesting rep schemes,
            with testing for different RMs each workout.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's an intermediate program, so you gonna find it most useful after your newbie gains are over. There's
            good variaty in exercises, and a lot of people reported getting serious gains and new PRs after running this
            program.

          <h2>Application of the GZCL Principle to the Jacked And Tan 2.0 program</h2>
          <h3>T1 Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            For the T1 exercise, we start with high volume and low intensity (high reps, lower weight), and progress to
            lower volume and higher intensity (lower reps, higher weight) - so called Linear Periodization.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, you need to define your training max (TM), which is approximately equal your 2RM (2 Rep Max). It'll
            be the basis for your "drop sets" for T1 exercise. Drop sets are the sets that you do after the Rep Max set,
            which are based on percentage of TM.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first set is a Rep Max set, where you have to work up to your Rep Max. For the first week it's 10RM, for
            the second - 8RM, etc. So, to work up your 10RM, you need to guess your approximate 10RM weight, and then do
            "warmup" sets, that are not fatiguing, slowly increasing the weight. Like, let's say you guessed your 10RM
            for Bench Press is 185lb. So, you do:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>5 reps with empty bar</li>
            <li>5 reps with 95lb</li>
            <li>3 reps with 135lb</li>
            <li>10 reps with 185lb</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you missed, and chose the weight that is too heavy, and let's say you only could do 8 reps. Or too light,
            and you did 12 reps. That's okay! You'll get better at this later on, just record your weight/reps, and move
            to the drop sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drop sets are sets that are based on the Training Max. E.g. for week 1 it's 50% of TM, 10 reps each. Last
            set is As Many Reps As Possible (AMRAP) - try to do as many reps as possible (leaving 1-2 reps in the tan).
            It's a good way to push yourself, and also to see if you need to adjust TM - if you can get more than 12
            reps there, you may want to consider increasing TM.
          </p>
          <p>On week 6, you measure your 1RM. You don't do any T1 drop sets (and any T2 exercises).</p>
          <p>
            After that, for the next 5 weeks, instead of %TM for the drop sets, you use percentage of your Rep Max for
            that week. E.g. on Week 7 you do your 6RM set first, and then the drop sets would be 85% of 6RM.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end, at the week 12, you do another 1RM measurement, without T1 drop sets and T2 exercises again.
          </p>
          <p>
            It sounds pretty complicated, but should be way more clear when you look at the example below, and also
            after playing around with the interactive example at the bottom of this page.
          </p>

                const weeksToRm = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 6, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1];
                return {
                  rm: Weight.getNRepMax(
                    state.tm as IWeight,
                    weeksToRm[week - 1],

                    t1Exercise.exerciseType.equipment

              weightInputs={[{ key: "tm", label: "Enter your TM weight" }]}
            />
          </div>
          <h3>T2a Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            The T2a exercise weight is usually based on the T1 Training Max weight (since T2a exercises are auxiliary
            exercises to T1 ones). The exception is Front Squat, which is using its own TM.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weight/volume is also changing week over week in a wave pattern, adding sets on lower weights, to
            compensate drop in volume.
          </p>
          <p>You skip the exercise on the Week 6 and Week 12, when you measure your 1RM for T1 exercise.</p>
          <ProgramDetailsExerciseExample

          />
          <h3>T2b and T3 Exercises</h3>
          <p>
            T2b and T3 exercises are pretty similar to each other, they just use different first set RM value. So, for
            the first set you attempt to do RM for the reps of that set (similar like for T1), record the weight, and
            then you do so called Max Rep Sets (MRS). Simply, try to do as many reps as possible with the same weight as
            you did for the first set. For the 2nd, 3rd, etc Max Reps Set you likely will be able to do less and less
            reps, but that's okay and expected, as you're accumulating fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>You skip these exercises on the Week 7 and Week 12</p>
