            GZCL: VDIP (Volume-dependent Intensity Progression) is a weightlifting program based on the{" "}
            <strong>GZCL principle</strong>, created by{" "}

              Cody Lefever
            </a>
            . The GZCL name comes from his Reddit username -{" "}
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/gzcl" target="_blank">
              u/gzcl
            </a>
            . It's a beginner-intermediate program, with the main idea is that each set is an AMRAP.
          </p>
          <ProgramDetailsGzclPrinciple />
          <h2>Application of the GZCL Principle to the VDIP program</h2>
          <h3>T1 Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            First, you come up with the initial weight - which is <strong>~85%</strong> of your 2RM for that exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            There're <strong>3 sets</strong>, and every set of every exercise in this program is a Max Rep Set (or AMRAP
            - As May Reps As Possible). You don't go to full failure, but leave 1-2 reps in the tank, but you do them as
            many as you can. For the following sets, with each set you likely will be able to do less and less reps, but
            that's okay. There's autoregulating part of the program, it'll increase the weight if the sum of all the
            reps is <strong>15</strong> or more by <strong>10lbs</strong>, and <strong>10</strong> or more - by{" "}
            <strong>5lb</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to track Rest Timer here, which should be <strong>3-5</strong> minutes for T1.
          </p>
          <h3>T2 Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            Similar to T1, but initial weight - <strong>~65%</strong> of your 2RM for that exercise (so you should be
            able to do more reps per set).
          </p>
          <p>
            It'll bump the weight by <strong>10lb</strong> if you got <strong>30</strong> or more total reps, and by{" "}
            <strong>5lb</strong> - if <strong>25</strong> or more total reps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rest Timer is smaller - <strong>2-3</strong> minutes for T2.
          </p>
          <h3>T3 Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            All the same as in T1/T2, but <strong>4 sets</strong>. Initial weight - <strong>~55%</strong> of your 2RM
            for that exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            It'll bump the weight by <strong>5lb</strong> if you got <strong>50</strong> reps or more total.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rest Timer is even smaller - <strong>30-90</strong> seconds for T3.
          </p>

            Check the interactive playground below to see how the program works, and what the weights/sets/reps look
            like for each day. You can finish the sets, and see how the weight would be changed for the next workout.

          <p>You can run GZCL: VDIP program in the Liftosaur app.</p>
