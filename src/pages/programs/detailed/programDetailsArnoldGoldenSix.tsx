        Arnold Schwarzenegger's Golden Six Program Explained

        <div className="flex-1">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Arnold Schwarzenegger's Golden Six routine is a classic full-body hypertrophy workout that was popularized
            by the legendary bodybuilder and actor during the early stages of his career. This program is often
            recommended for beginners - it's very simple, contains compound exercises, and provides enough volume and
            frequency for beginners. It's also pretty short - only takes about an hour to finish the workout.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Intermediate / advanced lifters would benefit more from other hypertrophy programs that provide more volume
            and exercise selection, like 5/3/1 Boring But Big, Dr. Swole Upper Lower program, etc.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The program is very simple - it's just 6 exercises repeated per day, 3 days a week, on alternate days.
          </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Squats</strong>: 4 sets of 10 reps.
              </p>
              <p>Squats are fundamental for building strength in the lower body and core.</p>
            </ExerciseListItem>
            <ExerciseListItem index={2} exerciseType={{ id: "benchPressWideGrip", equipment: "barbell" }} offsetY={-12}>
              <p>
                <strong>Wide-Grip Bench Press</strong>: 3 sets of 10 reps.
              </p>
              <p>
                This exercise targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps, with an emphasis on the chest. The wide grip is
                specifically good for working the pectoral muscles
              </p>
            </ExerciseListItem>
            <ExerciseListItem index={3} exerciseType={{ id: "chinUp", equipment: "bodyweight" }}>
              <p>
                <strong>Chin-Ups</strong>: AMRAP (as many reps as possible)
              </p>
              <p>
                If you can't do any of these, consider using an assisted chin-up machine or do negative chin-ups to
                start. These primarily work your back and biceps.
              </p>
            </ExerciseListItem>
            <ExerciseListItem index={4} exerciseType={{ id: "behindTheNeckPress", equipment: "barbell" }}>
              <p>
                <strong>Behind-the-Neck Press</strong>: 4 sets of 10 reps.
              </p>
              <p>
                This exercise targets the shoulders and triceps. Be careful with the 'behind-the-neck' part, it can be
                tough on the shoulders if done improperly. If it feels uncomfortable, a traditional overhead press to
                the front is a good alternative.
              </p>

            <ExerciseListItem index={5} exerciseType={{ id: "bicepCurl", equipment: "dumbbell" }}>
              <p>
                <strong>Barbell Curls</strong>: 3 sets of 10 reps.
              </p>
              <p>
                This exercise primarily targets the biceps. Be sure to keep your elbows still throughout the curl to
                ensure proper muscle engagement. If it feels uncomfortable, a dumbbell curl might be a good alternative.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>This is a good exercise to develop your core.</p>
            </ExerciseListItem>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">
            For progression, you do the last set as AMRAP - as many reps as possible. For <strong>Chin-Ups</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Crunches</strong>, next time you'll have to do at least as many as you were able to do this time +
            one more rep. And for the rest of the exercises, if you've achieved at least 13 reps, you should increase
            your weight by 5lb or 2.5kg in your next workout.{" "}
