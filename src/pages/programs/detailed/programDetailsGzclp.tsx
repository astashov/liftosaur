            It's a great beginner program. You do it three times a week and it's based on something called the GZCL
            principle. It's a good next step after doing 3-6 months of a Basic Beginner Routine or Starting Strength.
            It's also good for getting a lot of practice with exercises, because you do more reps than most other
            beginner programs.
          </p>
          <ProgramDetailsGzclPrinciple />
          <h2>Application of the GZCL Principle to GZCLP program</h2>
          <p>
            The GZCLP program has three workouts per week, but it's made up of four different days - A1, A2, B1, and B2.
            So, you might do A1 on Monday, A2 on Wednesday, B1 on Friday, and then start the next week with B2 on
            Monday. You keep rotating through these workouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            For <strong>T1 exercises</strong>, we use main lifts:
            <strong>
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "squat", equipment: "barbell" }} size="small" /> Squat,{" "}
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "deadlift", equipment: "barbell" }} size="small" />{" "}
              Deadlift,{" "}
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "benchPress", equipment: "barbell" }} size="small" />{" "}
              Bench Press,{" "}
              <ExerciseImage
                className="w-6"
                exerciseType={{ id: "overheadPress", equipment: "barbell" }}
                size="small"
              />{" "}
              Overhead Press{" "}
            </strong>
            . You start with 5 sets of 3 reps. The last rep should be as many as you can do (AMRAP), but{" "}
            <strong>don't push to total exhaustion</strong>. Stop when you feel you have <strong>1-2 reps</strong> left.
            You'll know you're close to your limit when the bar gets much slower, or your form starts to go wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you manage to finish all sets, you add <strong>5lb</strong> to the Bench Press and Overhead Press, and{" "}
            <strong>10lb</strong> to the Squat and Deadlift. If you can't finish, you keep the weight the same, but move
            on to "Stage 2" - 6 sets of 2 reps. You keep adding weight following the same rules. If you still can't
            finish - you move to "Stage 3" - 10 sets of 1 rep.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can't manage "Stage 3" you either find out your new 5 reps max (5RM) and use that to start "Stage 1"
            again, or you take off 10% of your current weight and go back to "Stage 1".
          </p>
          <p>So, to summarize:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Stage 1</strong> - 5 sets of 3 reps, AMRAP on the last set
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stage 2</strong> - 6 sets of 2 reps, AMRAP on the last set
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stage 3</strong> - 10 sets of 1 rep, AMRAP on the last set
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For <strong>T2 exercises</strong>, we also do the same main lifts as in T1:
            <strong>
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "squat", equipment: "barbell" }} size="small" /> Squat,{" "}
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "deadlift", equipment: "barbell" }} size="small" />{" "}
              Deadlift,{" "}
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "benchPress", equipment: "barbell" }} size="small" />{" "}
              Bench Press,{" "}
              <ExerciseImage
                className="w-6"
                exerciseType={{ id: "overheadPress", equipment: "barbell" }}
                size="small"
              />{" "}
              Overhead Press{" "}
            </strong>
            . When you're doing Squats as T1 exercise, you do Bench Press as T2. When Bench Press is T1, Squat is T2.
            You flip flop the T1 and T2.
          </p>
          <p>
            There're also 3 stages in T2, but you don't do AMRAP on the last set. You use the same progression rules as
            in T1 - if you successfully finish all sets, you increase the weight by <strong>5lb</strong> for Bench Press
            and Overhead Press, and by <strong>10lb</strong> for Squat and Deadlift. If you couldn't finish all sets,
            you switch to the next stage.
          </p>
          <p>There're the following stages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Stage 1</strong> - 3 sets of 10 reps, no AMRAP
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stage 2</strong> - 3 sets of 8 reps, no AMRAP
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stage 3</strong> - 3 sets of 6 reps, no AMRAP
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you fail "Stage 3", you use your last weight of "Stage 1", add 15lb to it, and switch to "Stage 1".</p>
          <p>
            For the <strong>T3 exercises</strong>, we use
            <strong>
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "latPulldown", equipment: "cable" }} size="small" />{" "}
              Lat Pulldown, and{" "}
              <ExerciseImage className="w-6" exerciseType={{ id: "bentOverRow", equipment: "dumbbell" }} size="small" />{" "}
              Dumbbell Bent Over Row
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>There're no stages, just do 3 sets of 15 reps, with AMRAP as a last set.</p>
          <p>Once you can do 25 reps or more - add 5lb to the weight.</p>
          <p>
