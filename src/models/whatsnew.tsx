        <li>
          That works both on the workout screen, and also in playgrounds on the edit program exercise screen. But on the

          or you want to create some custom equipment like "Safety Squat Bar", where the bar weights more than regular
          olympic bar.

        <li>
          Custom Equipment has all the same properties as built-in equipment (fixed/non-fixed, plates configuration),
          but also additionally you can specify the name, and "Similar To" field.
        </li>
        <li>
          "Similar To" for now only used for the exercise images, so if you create new equipment "Cable 2", with

          You now also can edit equipment in the Web Editor's Settings modal. You can create new equipment there (e.g.
          Safety Squat Bar), and assign to your exercises there. Custom equipment is properly exported into a link when
          you create a link of a program to share.

          Days to Weeks and reuse Days between Weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          That makes it easier to create multi-week programs with mesocycles, deload weeks, 1RM testing weeks, etc. You
          can create regular days, deload days or testing RM days, and then create e.g. 6 weeks with regular days, and
          then 1 week with deload days.
        </li>

          When multi-week mode is enabled, the program follows the order of days in weeks. I.e. when you finish a

          of the next week.

        <li>
          For the old programs, it was pretty convenient to just change <strong>state.weight</strong> state variable to
          adjust the weight across the sets of the exercise.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the new plain-text syntax, it got more complicated - if the program is not 1RM-based, you'd need to edit
          the absolute weight in the program text. Which could be quite cumbersome, especially if you have multiple
          weeks to adjust.
        </li>
        <li>
          So I added a way to quickly change the weights in the program exercise, in the "Edit" modal on the workout
          screen. It lists all the weights used by the exercise in a program, and you can quickly adjust them, either by
          typing, or by buttons, and there's also a Rep Max Calculator for convenience.

        </li>
        <li>
          It's a bit inconvenient if you only want to have this feature enabled on certain days/weeks. So, now

        <li>
          Liftoscript is an amazing way to define weightlifting programs, but typing on the phone could be tedious.
          Sometimes you need to tweak your program on a phone, while you're in a gym - adjust warmups, reps, weights,
          replace/add some exercises. But it's not very convenient to do it in a plain text editor on a phone.
        </li>
        <li>
          So now there's a UI mode for editing the programs, which is the default mode on a phone. You can do almost
          anything you could do in a plain text editor except defining progress, update blocks, descriptions and tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can still switch to the plain text mode by tapping on <IconDoc />, and adjust the program text. Also, for
          the Web Editor the plain text mode is still the main way of editing programs.

    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ This is a breaking change! Please read! ⚠️</li>

        <li>
          Exercises in Liftosaur used to consist of 2 parts - exercise name and equipment. For example:{" "}
          <strong>Bench Press</strong> and <strong>Dumbbell</strong>, or <strong>Squat</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Barbell</strong>. And when you select an exercise, you have to pick both equipment and name.
        </li>

        <li>There were several issues with that, but mainly two:</li>
        <li>
          <ul className="ml-4 list-disc">
            <li>
              It was confusing for new users to <strong>pick the equipment AND exercise name</strong>. The fact that you
              need to pick equipment first, and then tap on the exercise name, even if you just want to change the
              equipment for the current exercise was very weird.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Equipment was tied to the available plates</strong>. So, if you wanted to change bar/plates (like
              to a different barbell) - but keep the old ones - you'd get a new exercise, with the new history, graphs,
              etc - which sometimes was undesirable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          In this change I'm trying to simplify it - now exercise only consists of the exercise name. So, there're
          exercises like <strong>Bench Press, Dumbbell</strong> and <strong>Bench Press, Barbell</strong> - but those
          are 2 different exercises and exercise names.
        </li>

        <li>
          Equipment is separated from the exercise now, and it defines only the plates/bar/fixed weights. You can attach
          equipment to your exercises, and that will be used for rounding and plates calculator - but that's optional!
        </li>

        <li>
          So, for example, you can have <strong>Squat, Barbell</strong> exercise, and attach e.g.{" "}
          <strong>Olymplic Barbell</strong> equipment with 45lb bar and one set of plates. Or attach{" "}
          <strong>Standard Barbell</strong> with 35lb bar, and a different set of plates. Or don't attach any equipment
          - and just specify the default rounding - but in that case you won't have plates calculated.
        </li>

        <li>
          Or you may have <strong>Bicep Curl, Dumbbell</strong>, and attach <strong>Fixed Dumbbells</strong> or{" "}
          <strong>Loaded Dumbbells</strong> to it for rounding and plates calculation.
        </li>

        <li>
          It also changes how custom exercises work. You cannot choose equipment for custom exercises anymore - only the
          name. So, if you had custom exercises with different equipment or even custom equipment - they will be
          migrated to "equipment-less" new exercises.
        </li>

        <li>
          Another new feature is <strong>Gyms</strong>. You can create another <strong>Gym</strong> and specify
          different set of equipment for it. For each exercise you can specify equipment from each gym. And you can
          change the current gym in Settings, and that will define what equipment would be used for exercises.
        </li>

        <li>
          Gyms are totally optional, and by default you only have one. But it could be useful if you{" "}
          <strong>go to multiple gyms</strong>, or if you're <strong>travelling</strong> - then you can just create a
          new gym but don't attach equipment from it to exercises. In that case they'd just use default rounding, which
          could be good enough for travelling - you probably don't want to enter all the equipment details for temporary
          gyms.
        </li>

        <li>
          I know I say that a lot, but - that's a very big new feature, so could be bugs - so don't hesitate to email me
          at <strong>info@liftosaur.com</strong> or contact via Discord/Reddit if there're issues!

          also some user-facing changes related to that:

          <ul className="ml-4 list-disc">

              The Web Editor now has the "Save" button, and the programs don't autosave anymore. Autosaving sometimes
              worked pretty inconsistently, and it wasn't clear whether the changes got saved or not, so I'm trying to
              solve it with explicit saving.
            </li>
            <li>
              The app now has "Pull-to-refresh" functionality - pull the screen to the bottom to force fetch the data

          the changes from the app will overwrite the changes from the Web.
        </li>
        <li>
          That could be super frustrating. So as a way to fix that, I'm adding <strong>Program Version History</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now each time you save a program (both on the web or in the app), it creates a snapshot of the program. You
          can access the history of all the snapshots in the Web Editor (there's <strong>Versions</strong> link there,
          that opens a modal with all the snapshots), and restore any of the past snapshots. I'll store up to 100 recent
          snapshots.

          Added big bold "Start" and "Continue" buttons to the start workout card, because some new users were confused

          It's mostly useful if you keep forgetting to finish it, and then you open it in like 5 hours, and it syncs to
          Apple/Google Health, and your calories stats go crazy.

          minutes.

          Useful for debugging your scripts. Use it like:
          <div className="m-2 overflow-x-auto">
            <PlannerCodeBlock
              script={`Squat / 3x3 / progress: custom() {~

~}`}
            />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          It accepts any number of arguments, and outputs them in the playground or during a workout. Unfortunately
          Liftoscript still doesn't support strings, but you can use numbers to distinguish prints, like:
          <div className="m-2 overflow-x-auto">
            <PlannerCodeBlock
              script={`Squat / 3x3 / progress: custom() {~
  var.a = 10%
  print(1, completedReps[1])
  print(2, 30lb)
  print(3, var.a)
~}`}
            />
          </div>

        </li>
        <li>
          You can do that through UI, or in the full program mode you just add comments above the day or week, similarly
          how you do that for the exercises. Like:
        </li>
        <li>
          <div className="m-2 overflow-x-auto">
            <PlannerCodeBlock

// * Do this
// * Then do that
# Week 1

// This is a description for day 1
// **Do those exercises:**

          Available in the Web Editor (the picture icon on the right), or in the kebab menu in the top right corner on

          It generates an image of a workout that you could share on some default background, or use your photo as a

          sheet.

        </li>
        <li>
          Also added PRs indication to the history and to the exercise stats screens - highlighting if some set was a

          Changing the navigation quite drastically, to accomodate upcoming calendar. The following things changed:
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul className="pl-4 list-disc">
            <li>
              Footer buttons got changed - now there's "Home" for the history, "Settings" is renamed to "Me", and{" "}
              <strong>"Measurements" got moved into "Me"</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              To start a new workout, tap the Dumbbell button in the footer.{" "}
              <strong>No way to start a workout from the history screen anymore!</strong>
            </li>
            <li>If there's ongoing workout, tap the Dumbbell button again to get back to it.</li>
            <li>
              Each button in the footer resets the navigation stack. So if you go from Home to Program, there'd be no
              "Back" button. This is to make the app navigation more similar to other apps (like Instagram, Facebook,
              etc)
