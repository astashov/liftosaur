          It better shows the progress trend, since it combines weight and reps into one value. We use{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">Epley formula</a> to calculate it. It's enabled

    title: <span>Add Reuse Logic feature</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have multiple exercises in a program that share the same logic for sets, reps and weight, and also
          logic for updating those, you now can "reuse logic" from other exercises. This way you can avoid repeating the
          same logic over and over again, and you'll have a single source of truth for that logic (in the exercise you
          reuse).
        </li>
        <li>
          It should be useful for most programs, since usually they have multiple exercises following the same
          progression/deload pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each exercise still has its own state variables values, but it must have the same variable names and types.
