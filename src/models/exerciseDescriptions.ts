      "**Starting Position:**\n1. Kneel on the floor with a mat for support.\n2. Grip the handles of the ab wheel with both hands, shoulder-width apart.\n3. Keep your knees hip-width apart.\n\n**Execution:**\n1. **Engage Core:** Before you move, tighten your core muscles.\n2. **Roll Forward:** Slowly roll the wheel forward, extending your body. Keep your arms straight and control your movement to avoid letting your back sag.\n3. **Max Extension:** Extend until you feel a stretch in your abs without compromising your lower back position. Your body should form a straight line from your knees to your head.\n4. **Roll Back:** Engage your core as you pull the wheel back towards you, returning to the starting position. Focus on using your abdominal muscles rather than your arms or back.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.\n- Avoid letting your hips drop to prevent lower back strain.\n- Move in a controlled manner to maximize core engagement.\n\n**Breathing:**\n- Inhale while rolling forward.\n- Exhale as you pull back to the starting position.\n\n**Tips:**\n- Start with a limited range of motion if you're new to the exercise.\n- Progressively increase your range of motion as you gain strength and confidence.\n\n### Caution\nConsult a fitness professional if you have any pre-existing conditions or concerns before attempting this exercise.",

The barbell should be positioned over the mid-foot.\n\n### Starting Position\n1. **Grip the Barbell**: Bend at the hips, keeping your chest up and back straight. Grip the barbell with both hands, slightly wider than shoulder-width.\n2. **Body Alignment**: Shoulders should be slightly in front of the bar, and your spine should remain neutral.\n\n### Execution\n1. **Lift**: Engage your core, push through your heels, and straighten your hips and knees simultaneously to lift the barbell. Keep it close to your body.\n2. **Hip Hinge**: Focus on hinging at the hips rather than bending at the knees. Your knees should remain slightly bent.\n3. **Bar Path**: The barbell should travel in a straight line from the ground to mid-thigh. \n\n### Lowering the Bar\n1. **Hinge at the Hips**: Reverse the movement by pushing your hips back. Maintain a flat back and neutral spine as you lower the barbell.\n2. **Keep Close**: The bar should stay close to your legs throughout the descent until it returns to the ground.\n\n### Notes\n- **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the bar and exhale as you lift.\n- **Focus on Form**: Avoid rounding your back or locking your knees during the lift.\n- **Range of Motion**: Lower the bar down to your mid shin or until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.\n\n### Safety Tips\n- Start with lighter weights to master form.\n- Consider using lifting straps if grip is an issue. \n\nThis movement primarily targets the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back.",
