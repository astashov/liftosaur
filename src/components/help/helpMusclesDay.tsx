        We calculate usage for <strong>strength</strong> and <strong>hypertrophy</strong> separately. For{" "}
        <strong>strength</strong> we consider sets with reps &lt; 8, for <strong>hypertrophy</strong> - sets with reps

        In the <strong>Muscles used, relatively to each other</strong> section, for calculating percentages, we assume
        each <strong>target muscle is 3x of each synergist muscle</strong>, we combine all sets and reps, and then
        normalize by the most used muscle - it will be 100%. So all other muscles would be less than 100%.

      <p className="pb-2">
        In the <strong>List of exercises</strong> section, you could see the muscles for each exercise, split into
        target and synergist. It also shows the same numbers as above - how much each muscle is used in the day
        relatively to the top muscle.
