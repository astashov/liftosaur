A 12-week Push/Pull/Legs hypertrophy program by the late John Meadows (Mountain Dog Training). Each week has 3 base days (heavy, strength-focused) and 2 pump days (lighter, higher-rep), following Meadows' signature workout structure: activation exercise, heavy compound, moderate compound, isolation with intensity techniques, and a loaded stretch finisher. Exercises rotate every 4 weeks, and progression comes from increasing reps on base exercises over each 4-week block.

## Origin & Philosophy

Creeping Death 2 was created by John Meadows of [Mountain Dog Training](https://mountaindogdiet.com/programs/creeping-death-2/) as a sequel to his most popular program. The original Creeping Death was notoriously brutal — no volume or intensity waving, just relentless work. CD2 keeps that spirit but adds smarter structure: exercises rotate every 4 weeks, RPE guidance is built in, and pump days provide active recovery between base sessions.

Meadows' training philosophy follows a specific workout template. Each session moves through four phases: Phase 1 (activation/pump) uses a lighter exercise with 2 minutes rest to establish the mind-muscle connection. Phase 2 (explosive overload) uses a heavy compound with 3 minutes rest. Phase 3 (supramax pump) uses moderate compounds or supersets with 2 minutes rest and intensity techniques. Phase 4 (stretch position) finishes with a loaded stretch exercise at 90 seconds rest. This sequencing ensures muscles are warmed, overloaded, pumped, and then stretched under tension within a single session.

Meadows programs Pull before Push because it gives the lower back a break between legs and back — he didn't want squats and a deadlift variation on consecutive days. Rear delts are trained on push day so the entire deltoid gets pumped together.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (1+ years of consistent training). You need reliable mind-muscle connection for the activation and pump work to be effective.
- **Prerequisites**: Comfortable with exercises like [{Bent Over One Arm Row}], [{Squat}], [{Incline Bench Press}], and various cable/machine movements. Familiarity with intensity techniques (drop sets, rest-pause) is helpful.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. The volume is manageable for natural lifters when nutrition and sleep are dialed in, but cutting would make recovery difficult.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- The four-phase workout structure (activation, overload, pump, stretch) ensures thorough stimulation of each muscle group in every session
- Exercises rotate every 4 weeks, preventing staleness and hitting muscles from different angles across the 12-week cycle
- Pump days provide additional frequency without heavy CNS fatigue — sessions are shorter and less taxing
- RPE-based loading removes guesswork about intensity for each exercise
- The 5-day version (dropping one pump day) is time-efficient while still hitting each muscle group 1.5-2x per week

**Cons**

- The program is exercise-heavy — base days have 6-8 exercises each, which can run 60-90 minutes
- No barbell [{Deadlift}] in the program — back training uses rows, rack pulls, and hyperextensions instead
- Direct quad work is relatively low compared to hamstring and back volume — quad-dominant lifters may want to add [{Leg Extension}] volume
- Intensity techniques (drop sets, rest-pause) require self-discipline to execute properly without degrading form
- No periodized deload — Meadows expects you to self-regulate, taking a deload week when performance or motivation drops

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Pull/Push/Legs with 3 base days and 2 pump days per week (originally written as 6 days, but Meadows recommended dropping one pump day for most trainees)
- **Periodization**: Rep-based progressive overload within 4-week exercise blocks; exercises rotate at weeks 5 and 9
- **Schedule**: Pull (Base) → Push (Base) → Legs (Base) → Pull (Pump) → Push (Pump) → Off → Off. The leg pump day is dropped in this 5-day version.
- **Day layout**: Pull base hits back, abs, biceps. Push base hits chest, shoulders (including rear delts), triceps. Leg base hits hamstrings, quads, calves.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Pull days** open with a rowing activation (such as [{Bent Over One Arm Row}] or [{Incline Row}]) to pump the lats, then move to a heavy pulling movement ([{Bent Over Row}] or [{Pendlay Row}]) for overload, followed by a vertical pull/pullover superset for width, and finish with [{Face Pull}] for rear delts and traps. Biceps are trained at the end with a barbell curl and a stretch-position curl.

**Push days** start with a pressing activation (dumbbell or machine press), then a heavy compound like [{Incline Bench Press}] or [{Bench Press}] with controlled eccentrics. Chest supersets with flies create the pump phase. [{Lateral Raise}] paired with [{Reverse Fly}] covers all three delt heads. Triceps get pushdown and extension work.

**Leg days** begin with [{Seated Leg Curl}] as the activation (Meadows always started legs with hamstrings to warm the knees), then [{Squat}] or [{Front Squat}] with paused eccentrics as the heavy compound, followed by [{Leg Press}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] for quad volume, [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] or [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] for posterior chain, and calves to finish.

**Pump days** mirror the base day muscle groups but use lighter weights, higher reps, shorter rest periods (60 seconds), and more machine-based exercises. The goal is blood flow and recovery, not progressive overload.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Base day compounds** (Phase 2): 4-5 sets of 5-8 reps at RPE 8-9. These are the primary overload exercises and progress through added reps across the 4-week block.

**Base day activation** (Phase 1): 3-4 sets of 8-10 reps at RPE 8-9. Controlled tempo, focus on contraction.

**Base day pump/superset** (Phase 3): 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps at RPE 9-10. Often supersetted. May include drop sets or rest-pause on the final set.

**Base day stretch** (Phase 4): 3 sets of 10-15 reps with a loaded stretch hold on the last rep of each set. RPE 8-9.

**Pump day exercises**: 3-4 sets of 12-20 reps with 60 seconds rest. RPE 7-8. No grinding reps.

**Biceps/Triceps**: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps on base days, 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps on pump days.

**Calves**: 4-6 sets of 10-15 reps with full stretch at the bottom.

## Progressive Overload

Meadows uses **rep-based overload** as the primary progression method in CD2. Volume stays steady, but you aim to hit more reps within the prescribed range each week on the base exercises.

**How it works**: Each 4-week exercise block starts at the low end of the rep range. Over the 4 weeks, aim to add 1-2 reps per set to the base exercises. When you hit the top of the range across all sets, increase weight by the smallest increment (5lb upper body, 10lb lower body) and restart at the low end.

**Failure protocol**: If you can't add reps for 2 consecutive weeks, the weight is too heavy. Drop by 10% and rebuild.

**Pump days don't progress** — they stay at the same moderate weight with high reps. The goal is blood flow, not overload.

**Deload**: Not programmed, but recommended when you notice performance dropping, excessive soreness past the first 4 weeks, or loss of motivation. To deload: follow any week's workout but remove 20% of volume and keep all sets at RPE 8 or below.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the full 12 weeks. Many lifters run it twice back-to-back (24 weeks total) since the exercise rotation keeps it fresh. After completing CD2, consider running another Meadows program like Gamma Bomb (which uses volume increases as the overload method instead of reps) for a different stimulus, or transition to a strength-focused program like [Bullmastiff](/programs/bullmastiff) to capitalize on the muscle you've built.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You've completed 1-2 full runs and want a different training stimulus, or you want to focus more on strength.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, dumbbells, squat rack, adjustable bench, cable machine, leg press, leg curl machine, and a pull-up bar. The program relies heavily on cables and machines for pump work.

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Chin Up}] or [{Pull Up}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Goblet Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]
- [{Seated Leg Curl}] → [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] (not ideal — different movement pattern)
- [{Chest Fly, Leverage Machine}] → [{Chest Fly}] (dumbbells)
- [{Triceps Pushdown}] → [{Skullcrusher}] or [{Bench Dip}]
- [{Face Pull}] → [{Reverse Fly}] or [{Reverse Fly, Band}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}]

## Rest Times

- **Phase 1 (Activation)**: 120 seconds
- **Phase 2 (Heavy compound)**: 180 seconds
- **Phase 3 (Pump/Superset)**: 120 seconds
- **Phase 4 (Stretch position)**: 90 seconds
- **Pump days**: 60 seconds for all exercises
- **Arms**: 60-90 seconds

## How to Pick Starting Weights

For each exercise, pick a weight you can handle for the prescribed reps at the listed RPE. Err on the side of lighter — the program's intensity techniques and loaded stretches add difficulty beyond what the raw sets/reps suggest.

**For base compounds**: Start with a weight that leaves 2-3 reps in reserve (RPE 7-8) in week 1. By week 4, you should be at RPE 9-10 through accumulated rep increases.

**For pump exercises**: Use a weight you can move with perfect control for the full rep range. If you're grinding reps on pump days, the weight is too heavy.

**If you don't know your starting weights**: Do a trial workout at moderate effort, find a challenging but manageable weight for each exercise, and use that as your baseline.

## Common Modifications

- **3-day version**: Drop both pump days and run only the 3 base days. This works well for time-crunched lifters but sacrifices frequency.
- **6-day version**: Add the third pump day (Legs Pump) on Saturday. Only do this if recovery, nutrition, and sleep are fully dialed in.
- **Exercise swaps on pump days**: Meadows encouraged swapping pump day exercises freely based on what equipment is available and what feels good. The base day exercises are more important to keep consistent.
- **Extra quad work**: If quads are lagging, add 3 sets of [{Leg Extension}] at the end of leg base day.
- **Extra chest work**: If chest is lagging, add [{Chest Fly}] on the push pump day or superset [{Push Up}] after bench pressing movements.

### Is Creeping Death 2 good for natural lifters?

Yes. Multiple natural competitive bodybuilders have reported excellent results running Creeping Death 2. The 5-day version with one pump day dropped is particularly well-suited for natural lifters who need more recovery time. Make sure nutrition and sleep are dialed in — the volume is manageable but demands proper recovery.

### How many days a week is Creeping Death 2?

The program is written for 6 days but John Meadows recommended most people drop one pump day for a 5-day-per-week schedule. The 3 base days (Pull, Push, Legs) should always be done. The pump days add frequency and volume but are optional.

### What's the difference between Creeping Death 2 and Gamma Bomb?

Creeping Death 2 uses a Push/Pull/Legs split with rep-based overload — volume stays the same but you aim to increase reps each week. Gamma Bomb uses volume increases as the overload method, adding sets over the training cycle. CD2 has higher intensity per set while Gamma Bomb accumulates more total volume.

### Can I do Creeping Death 2 while cutting?

It's not ideal. The intensity techniques and volume can be difficult to recover from in a caloric deficit. If you run it while cutting, drop both pump days and reduce working sets on base days by 20%. Keep protein high (1g per pound of bodyweight minimum).

### How long are the workouts in Creeping Death 2?

Base day workouts run 60-90 minutes depending on rest times and how many supersets you do. Pump day workouts are shorter — typically 45-60 minutes — since rest periods are only 60 seconds and weights are lighter.

### What is a loaded stretch in Creeping Death 2?

A loaded stretch is an exercise performed from the stretch position where you hold the final rep in the stretched position for several seconds. For example, on a Dumbbell Chest Fly, you'd hold the last rep with arms wide open for a 10-30 second isohold. This creates mechanical tension in the lengthened position, which research shows is effective for hypertrophy.

### Should I go to failure on every set in Creeping Death 2?

No. Meadows provides an RPE target for each exercise. Most sets should be RPE 8-9 (1-2 reps in reserve). Only the final sets of intensity technique exercises (drop sets, rest-pause) should approach true failure at RPE 10. Going to failure on every set will compromise recovery and subsequent workouts.

### What should I do if I need a deload during Creeping Death 2?

Follow any week's workout but remove 20% of volume (drop 1 set from most exercises) and keep all sets at RPE 8 or below — no sets to failure. Signs you need a deload include declining performance, persistent soreness past the first 4 weeks, and lack of motivation to train.
