A 5-day powerbuilding split created by Dr. Layne Norton that trains each muscle group twice per week — once heavy for strength on power days (3-5 reps) and once with higher volume on hypertrophy days (8-20 reps). Each hypertrophy session opens with explosive speed work using 65-70% of power day weights, bridging strength and size gains for intermediate to advanced lifters.

## Origin & Philosophy

PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training) was created by Dr. Layne Norton, a pro natural bodybuilder, two-time IPF World Champion powerlifter, and PhD in Nutritional Sciences. He first published the program around 2008-2009 on [SimplyShredded](https://simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html), and later on his own site [Biolayne](https://biolayne.com/articles/training/phat-power-hypertrophy-adaptive-training/).

Norton developed PHAT from personal experience: after years of stagnation, a friend convinced him to try a hybrid routine mixing heavy compound work (squats, deadlifts, presses) with lighter pump-focused hypertrophy work, hitting each body part twice per week. The results convinced him that combining both training styles — rather than choosing one — was optimal for natural lifters. PHAT is a form of non-linear periodization, alternating between neural (power) and metabolic (hypertrophy) stimuli within the same training week.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (1-3+ years of consistent training). You should be proficient with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Bent Over Row}], and [{Overhead Press}] form.
- **Primary goal**: Simultaneous strength and hypertrophy ("powerbuilding").
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. The volume is very high — running PHAT on a caloric deficit will be difficult to recover from.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Each muscle group is trained twice per week (power + hypertrophy), which research supports as superior to once-per-week training for growth
- Speed work at the start of hypertrophy days develops explosiveness and reinforces motor patterns from power days
- Power days build a strength base that lets you use heavier loads on hypertrophy days over time
- The program covers a wide variety of rep ranges (3-20) across the week, providing diverse stimuli

**Cons**

- Sessions often run 75-120 minutes due to the high number of exercises (7-10 per workout)
- 5 training days per week is a serious time commitment — roughly 6-8+ hours of gym time weekly
- High volume can lead to burnout for natural lifters without disciplined deloading
- No direct ab work is programmed — you need to add your own
- Speed work requires self-discipline to keep the weight light and move explosively; many lifters go too heavy

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Upper/Lower Power + Back & Shoulders / Lower Body / Chest & Arms Hypertrophy
- **Periodization**: Daily undulating periodization (DUP) — power and hypertrophy stimuli alternate within the same week
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — Day 1 Upper Power, Day 2 Lower Power, Day 3 Rest, Day 4 Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy, Day 5 Lower Body Hypertrophy, Day 6 Chest & Arms Hypertrophy, Day 7 Rest
- **Typical week**: Each muscle group gets hit twice — once with heavy, low-rep compound work on power days, then again with higher-rep, higher-volume hypertrophy work later in the week. Each hypertrophy session begins with speed sets of the corresponding power day compound.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Upper Body Power** opens with [{Bent Over Row}] as the primary pulling movement for back thickness, followed by [{Pull Up}] and [{Lat Pulldown}] as assistance pulls covering both vertical planes. [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] is the primary press — dumbbells allow greater range of motion and address imbalances. [{Chest Dip}] adds a secondary pressing movement that also loads the triceps. [{Shoulder Press}] covers overhead pressing. [{Bicep Curl, EZ Bar}] and [{Skullcrusher}] finish with direct arm work.

**Lower Body Power** leads with [{Squat}] for maximal quad and posterior chain loading, followed by [{Hack Squat}] and [{Leg Extension}] as quad-focused assistance. [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] is the primary hamstring/posterior chain movement with [{Lying Leg Curl}] for direct hamstring isolation. [{Standing Calf Raise}] and [{Seated Calf Raise}] cover the gastrocnemius and soleus respectively.

**Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy** opens with speed [{Bent Over Row}] to reinforce the pulling pattern from power day, then transitions to moderate-rep pulling volume across multiple angles: [{Lat Pulldown}] (vertical), [{Seated Row}] (horizontal), [{Bent Over One Arm Row}] (unilateral). [{Shoulder Press}] provides overhead pressing volume, [{Upright Row}] hits the upper traps and medial delts, and [{Lateral Raise}] isolates the side delts.

**Lower Body Hypertrophy** starts with speed [{Squat}] work, then builds quad volume through [{Hack Squat}], [{Leg Press}], and [{Leg Extension}] at progressively higher rep ranges. [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] provides the hamstring stretch-focus complement to power day's [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], with [{Lying Leg Curl}] and [{Seated Leg Curl}] for direct hamstring isolation. Calves are hit with [{Standing Calf Raise}] and [{Seated Calf Raise}].

**Chest & Arms Hypertrophy** begins with speed [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] work, then builds chest volume through [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}], and [{Incline Chest Fly, Cable}]. Biceps get a full spectrum from heavy [{Preacher Curl, EZ Bar}] through moderate [{Concentration Curl}] to high-rep [{Bicep Curl, Cable}]. Triceps follow the same pattern: [{Triceps Extension}] (heavy), [{Triceps Pushdown}] (moderate), [{Cable Kickback}] (high-rep pump).

**Substitution options**: [{Bent Over Row}] can be swapped for [{Pendlay Row}] or [{T Bar Row}]. [{Pull Up}] can be replaced with [{Chin Up}]. [{Hack Squat}] can be replaced with [{Leg Press}] or [{Front Squat}]. [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] and [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] are interchangeable. [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}] can be swapped for [{Bench Press}] (barbell) if no machine is available.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Power day main compounds** ([{Bent Over Row}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Squat}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}]): 3 sets of 3-5 reps. Maximum effort — these are the heaviest sets of the week for each muscle group.
- **Power day assistance** ([{Pull Up}], [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Chest Dip}], [{Shoulder Press}], [{Hack Squat}], [{Leg Extension}], [{Lying Leg Curl}]): 2-3 sets of 6-10 reps. Moderate weight to support the main lifts without excessive fatigue.
- **Power day isolation** ([{Bicep Curl, EZ Bar}], [{Skullcrusher}], [{Standing Calf Raise}], [{Seated Calf Raise}]): 2-3 sets of 6-10 reps.
- **Speed work** (first exercise each hypertrophy day): 6 sets of 3 reps at 65-70% of power day weight. Focus on explosive concentric — if you can't move it fast, it's too heavy.
- **Hypertrophy main work**: 3 sets of 8-12 reps for compound movements, 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps for secondary work, 2-3 sets of 15-20 reps for isolation/pump work.

## Progressive Overload

This implementation uses **double progression** for all exercises: work within the prescribed rep range, and when you can hit the top-end reps on all sets, add weight and reset to the bottom of the range.

- **Power compounds** (3-5 reps): Add 5lb when you hit 3x5 across all sets, reset to 3x3 at the new weight.
- **Power assistance** (6-10 reps): Add 5lb when you hit the top of the rep range on all sets.
- **Hypertrophy compounds** (8-12 reps): Add 5lb when you can complete all sets at 12 reps.
- **Hypertrophy isolation** (12-15, 15-20 reps): Add 5lb when you can complete all sets at the top of the range.
- **Speed work**: Does not auto-progress. Use 65-70% of your current power day weight for that lift. Adjust manually as your power day numbers increase.

**When you stall**: If you can't add reps for 2-3 consecutive sessions on a compound lift, first try rotating the exercise variant (e.g., swap [{Bent Over Row}] for [{Pendlay Row}]). If that doesn't help, take a deload week at 60-70% of your normal weights, then resume.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run PHAT for **12-16 weeks**, taking a deload week every 6 weeks. Norton's original recommendation is four 3-week cycles (2 weeks training, 1 week deload) for 12 weeks total.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You're consistently failing to recover between sessions despite deloading, power day numbers have stalled for 4+ weeks, or you can't sustain 5 training days per week.

**What next**: If you want to focus more on strength, transition to [5/3/1](/programs/the5314b). If you want to simplify to 4 days, try [PHUL](/programs/phul). If you want more structured periodization, a [GZCL](/programs/gzclp) variant would work well.

## Equipment Needed

The program as written requires a barbell, dumbbells, a cable machine, a leg press machine, a hack squat machine, and leg curl/extension machines.

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Hack Squat}] → [{Front Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]
- [{Leg Extension}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Lunge}]
- [{Lying Leg Curl}] / [{Seated Leg Curl}] → [{Romanian Deadlift}] or [{Good Morning}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Front Squat}] or [{Goblet Squat}]
- [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}] → [{Bench Press}] or [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}]
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}]
- [{Cable Kickback}] → [{Skullcrusher, Dumbbell}]

## Rest Times

- **Power day main compounds**: 3-5 minutes. Norton recommends up to 5-6 minutes if needed to fully recover between heavy sets.
- **Power day assistance/isolation**: 90-120 seconds.
- **Speed work**: Maximum 90 seconds between sets.
- **Hypertrophy compounds**: 90-120 seconds.
- **Hypertrophy isolation**: 60-90 seconds.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**Power day compounds**: Start with a weight you can lift for 5 reps with 1-2 reps left in reserve. This is roughly 80-85% of your 1RM. It's better to start conservative — the double progression will bring you to the right working weights within 2-3 weeks.

**Hypertrophy exercises**: Pick a weight where you can hit the bottom of the rep range on all sets while staying 1-2 reps from failure. For the first 2-4 weeks, Norton specifically recommends staying 1-2 reps shy of failure on every set to allow your body to adapt to the volume.

**Speed work**: Use 65-70% of the weight you used for your power day compound that week. For example, if you squatted 225lb for 3x5 on Lower Power day, use 145-155lb for speed squats on Lower Hypertrophy day.

**Common mistake**: Going too heavy on speed sets. If the bar isn't moving explosively, drop the weight. The point is acceleration, not grinding reps.

## Common Modifications

- **Add abs**: Tack on 2-3 sets of [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Cable Crunch}] at the end of lower body days or on rest days.
- **Add rear delts**: [{Face Pull}] or [{Reverse Fly}] at the end of upper body days — the program is light on rear delt isolation.
- **Exercise rotation**: Norton recommends rotating power day compounds every 2-3 weeks. Swap [{Squat}] for [{Front Squat}], [{Bent Over Row}] for [{Pendlay Row}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] for [{Bench Press}], etc.
- **Reduce volume if cutting**: Drop 1 set from each exercise and skip the highest-rep isolation work to manage recovery.
- **4-day variant**: Combine Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy with Chest & Arms Hypertrophy into a single Upper Hypertrophy day, cutting 1-2 exercises from each.

### Is PHAT good for beginners?

No. PHAT is an intermediate to advanced program requiring at least 1-2 years of consistent training experience. The volume (5 days, 7-10 exercises per session), intensity, and frequency are too high for beginners and will likely lead to burnout or injury. Start with a 3-day beginner program like [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) and build your base first.

### How many days a week is PHAT?

PHAT is a 5-day program: Upper Power (Monday), Lower Power (Tuesday), rest (Wednesday), Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy (Thursday), Lower Body Hypertrophy (Friday), Chest & Arms Hypertrophy (Saturday), rest (Sunday). You can shift the days to fit your schedule, but keep the rest day between power and hypertrophy blocks.

### What is speed work in the PHAT program?

Speed work is 6 sets of 3 reps at 65-70% of your power day weight for that lift, performed at the start of each hypertrophy session. The goal is to move the weight as explosively as possible through the concentric phase. Rest no more than 90 seconds between sets. If you can't move the bar fast, the weight is too heavy.

### How long should I run PHAT?

Run PHAT for 12-16 weeks. Norton's original structure is four 3-week cycles (2 training weeks, 1 deload week) for 12 total weeks. Take a deload at 60-70% of your normal weights every 6 weeks. Move on when you can't recover between sessions or power day numbers have stalled for a month.

### How long do PHAT workouts take?

Sessions typically run 75-120 minutes depending on the day. Power days with longer rest periods (3-5 minutes) tend to be slightly shorter due to fewer exercises. Hypertrophy days have more exercises but shorter rest periods. Budget 90 minutes per session to be safe.

### What's the difference between PHAT and PHUL?

Both combine power and hypertrophy training. PHUL is 4 days per week (upper/lower split repeated), while PHAT is 5 days with a more bodybuilding-oriented hypertrophy split (back/shoulders, legs, chest/arms). PHAT also includes speed work. PHUL is a good stepping stone if you find PHAT's volume too high.

### Can I do PHAT while cutting?

It's possible but difficult. The high volume makes recovery harder on a caloric deficit. If you try it, drop 1 set per exercise, skip the highest-rep isolation work, and be willing to accept slower progression. Many lifters switch to a lower-volume program like PHUL or 5/3/1 when cutting.

### Should I rotate exercises on PHAT?

Norton recommends rotating power day compounds every 2-3 weeks to prevent staleness and address weak points. For example, swap barbell squats for front squats, or bent over rows for Pendlay rows. Hypertrophy day exercises can stay more consistent since the lighter loads are less taxing on joints and the nervous system.
