## Origin & Philosophy

Created by Reddit user [/u/gregariousHermit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/) as an alternative to the Dumbbell Stopgap routine listed in the r/Fitness wiki. The program exists because many beginners only have access to dumbbells — whether at home, in hotel gyms, or in poorly equipped commercial gyms — and need a structured routine that still follows proven principles.

The core philosophy is simple: take a well-established training split (Push/Pull/Legs), apply it with dumbbells, and use double progression to drive consistent gains. It's not meant to replace a barbell program long-term, but it's a solid starting point when barbells aren't available.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level:** Complete beginners (0-12 months)
- **Prerequisites:** None. If you can't do pull-ups yet, start with negatives.
- **Primary goal:** Hypertrophy with some strength gains
- **Best for:** Anyone with only dumbbells available, travelers using hotel gyms, home gym lifters without a barbell
- **Cut/bulk/maintenance:** Works for all, though a caloric surplus will maximize muscle growth

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Requires only dumbbells, a bench, and a pull-up bar — no barbells, cables, or machines needed
- Simple double progression removes all guesswork about when to increase weight
- Each session has only 5 exercises, keeping workouts short and focused
- The PPL split lets you train 4-6 days per week since each day targets different muscle groups, allowing adequate recovery
- Covers all major movement patterns: horizontal push, vertical push, horizontal pull, vertical pull, squat, hinge, and isolation work

**Cons:**
- [{Goblet Squat}] will stall first — you'll hit the ceiling of your heaviest dumbbell before other exercises, limiting lower body progression
- No lateral delt isolation — shoulders get trained through [{Arnold Press}] and [{Reverse Fly}] but side delts aren't directly targeted
- No hamstring isolation — [{Single Leg Deadlift}] and [{Lunge, Dumbbell}] involve hamstrings but don't isolate them
- Progressive overload is limited by available dumbbell increments (typically 5lb jumps), which can be too large for isolation exercises like rear delts and biceps

## Program Structure

- **Split type:** Push/Pull/Legs (PPL)
- **Periodization style:** Double progression (increase reps to 12, then increase weight)
- **Schedule:** Fixed 3-day cycle repeated. Run it 3 days per week minimum (Push/Pull/Legs), or up to 6 days per week (Push/Pull/Legs/Push/Pull/Legs) with one rest day. A 6-day schedule hits each muscle group twice per week, which is optimal for hypertrophy in beginners.
- Core work ([{Hanging Leg Raise}]) is included on Push and Legs days.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Push Day** targets chest, shoulders, and triceps:
- [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] — primary horizontal press, builds chest mass and pressing strength
- [{Incline Chest Fly}] — stretches the chest through a deep range of motion at an incline angle, emphasizing upper chest fibers
- [{Arnold Press}] — the rotation hits all three deltoid heads, giving broader shoulder coverage than a standard press
- [{Triceps Extension}] — isolates the long head of the triceps, which the pressing movements don't fully train
- [{Hanging Leg Raise}] — direct core work

**Pull Day** targets back, rear delts, traps, and biceps:
- [{Pull Up}] — vertical pull that builds lats and overall back width; the only bodyweight exercise in the program
- [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] — horizontal pull targeting mid-back thickness and lats
- [{Reverse Fly}] — isolates rear delts, which are undertrained by rows and pull-ups alone
- [{Shrug}] — isolates upper traps
- [{Bicep Curl}] — isolates biceps, which are worked but not maximized by rows and pull-ups

**Legs Day** targets quads, glutes, hamstrings, and calves:
- [{Goblet Squat}] — primary quad/glute exercise; front-loaded position also challenges core
- [{Lunge, Dumbbell}] — unilateral movement that builds each leg independently and improves balance
- [{Single Leg Deadlift}] — hip hinge pattern targeting hamstrings and glutes while building single-leg stability
- [{Standing Calf Raise}] — direct calf work
- [{Hanging Leg Raise}] — additional core work

## Set & Rep Scheme

Every exercise uses **3 sets with a cap of 12 reps per set**. Perform as many reps as you can on each set with good form, but stop at 12 even if you could do more.

This 3x(up to 12) scheme puts training firmly in the hypertrophy range (6-12 reps). The cap at 12 ensures you're using a weight heavy enough to drive muscle growth — if 12 reps is easy, you need more weight.

There are no AMRAP sets, percentages, or RPE targets. The simplicity is deliberate: beginners need to focus on form and consistent effort, not complex programming variables.

## Progressive Overload

**Weight increases:** When you complete all 3 sets at 12 reps for an exercise, increase the weight by one increment (5lb for compound movements, 2.5lb for isolation movements) on the next workout.

**What counts as progress:** Increasing reps workout-to-workout counts as progress, even if you don't add weight. Going from 3x10 to 3x11 means the program is working.

**Deload trigger:** If your total reps don't improve on an exercise for 3 consecutive workouts, deload that exercise by dropping 2 weight increments and work your way back up. This only applies to the stalled exercise — other exercises continue progressing normally.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run this program for as long as you continue making progress — typically **3-6 months** for most beginners. Signs it's time to move on:

- You consistently max out your dumbbell weight on multiple exercises (especially [{Goblet Squat}])
- You're stalling and deloading frequently across many exercises
- You have access to a barbell and want faster strength progression

**Transition to:** If you get access to a barbell, switch to a barbell beginner program like [Basic Beginner Routine](/programs/basicBeginner), [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp), or [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b). These programs allow larger weight increments on lower body exercises and drive faster overall strength gains.

## Equipment Needed

- **Adjustable dumbbells** (or a range of dumbbells from light to heavy). A single pair of fixed dumbbells will not work — you need the ability to increase weight over time.
- **Bench** — adjustable (flat + incline) is ideal. A flat bench works, but replace [{Incline Chest Fly}] with flat [{Chest Fly}].
- **Pull-up bar** — a doorframe-mounted bar is fine. If you have no bar at all, substitute [{Inverted Row}] using a sturdy table edge.

No barbells, cable machines, or plate-loaded equipment required.

## Rest Times

**90 seconds** between all sets. This is enough recovery for dumbbell weights while keeping sessions short.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Start with the **lightest dumbbell you have** for each exercise and work your way up. This is directly from the original program — the author explicitly recommends starting light.

For most beginners:
- **Compound pressing** ([{Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Arnold Press}]): 15-30lb per dumbbell
- **Isolation** ([{Incline Chest Fly}], [{Reverse Fly}], [{Bicep Curl}], [{Triceps Extension}]): 10-20lb per dumbbell
- **Lower body** ([{Goblet Squat}], [{Lunge, Dumbbell}], [{Single Leg Deadlift}]): 20-35lb per dumbbell
- **Shrug:** 25-40lb per dumbbell
- **Pull-ups and Hanging Leg Raises:** Bodyweight only to start

If 12 reps is easy on your first workout, you started too light — that's fine. You'll quickly add weight in the first few sessions.

## Common Modifications

- **Can't do pull-ups:** Start with negative pull-ups (jump to the top, lower yourself slowly over 3-5 seconds). Alternatively, break the rep target into more sets (e.g., 6 sets of 2 instead of 3 sets of 4).
- **No incline bench:** Replace [{Incline Chest Fly}] with flat [{Chest Fly}].
- **Goblet squat maxed out:** When you hit your heaviest dumbbell, replace [{Goblet Squat}] with [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Pistol Squat}] to continue progressing with less weight.
- **Want more calf work:** Perform [{Standing Calf Raise}] on an elevated surface (step or plate) for full range of motion. Switch to single-leg calf raises when the weight gets easy.
- **Adding lateral raises:** The program has no direct lateral delt work. Adding [{Lateral Raise}] to Push Day is a common and reasonable addition.

### Can I build muscle with only dumbbells?

Yes, especially as a beginner. The Dumbbell P/P/L program covers all major movement patterns using only dumbbells, a bench, and a pull-up bar. You'll make solid progress for 3-6 months before potentially needing barbells for continued lower body progression.

### How many days a week is Dumbbell P/P/L?

You can run it anywhere from 3 to 6 days per week. The minimum is 3 days (one push, one pull, one legs session). For optimal results, run it 6 days per week with each muscle group trained twice and one rest day.

### How does progression work in Dumbbell P/P/L?

The program uses double progression. Start each exercise at a weight where you can do at least 8 reps per set, then work up to 3 sets of 12. Once you hit 12 reps on all 3 sets, increase the weight by 5lb for compounds or 2.5lb for isolation exercises.

### What do I do when goblet squats get too heavy?

Goblet squats are usually the first exercise to stall because you'll max out your heaviest dumbbell. When that happens, switch to Bulgarian split squats or pistol squats, which let you continue progressing with less weight by training one leg at a time.

### What if I can't do pull-ups yet?

Start with negative pull-ups: jump to the top position and lower yourself slowly over 3-5 seconds. Alternatively, break the rep target into more sets, like 6 sets of 2 instead of 3 sets of 4. You can also substitute inverted rows using a sturdy table edge.

### Is Dumbbell P/P/L good for home workouts?

Yes, it's one of the best structured home gym programs. You only need adjustable dumbbells (or a range of fixed dumbbells), a bench (ideally adjustable for incline), and a pull-up bar. No barbells, cables, or machines are required.
