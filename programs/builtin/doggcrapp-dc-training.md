A high-intensity, low-volume bodybuilding program built around rest-pause sets, exercise rotation, and widowmaker squats. Created by Dante Trudel in 2000, DC Training hits each muscle group 3 times every 2 weeks through a rotating A/B split with 3 training days per week. Each muscle gets only one all-out working set per session — but that set is a brutally intense rest-pause triple to failure. The program is designed for advanced lifters who have stalled on traditional high-volume bodybuilding routines.

## Origin & Philosophy

DC Training was created by Dante Trudel, who posted his training philosophy to the IntenseMuscle.com forum in 2000 under the username "DoggCrapp." What he thought would be read by a few dozen people exploded into a 118-page thread that was copied and pasted across bodybuilding forums everywhere. Pro bodybuilders including David Henry, Steve Kuclo, and Mark Dugdale adopted the system, lending it credibility beyond internet hype.

Trudel's core principle: **the bodybuilder who makes the greatest strength gains in a controlled manner will make the greatest size gains.** This puts DC Training in direct opposition to traditional bodybuilding dogma that emphasizes volume and "the pump." Instead of doing 16-20 sets per muscle group once a week, DC uses a single rest-pause working set per muscle per session — but trains each muscle 3 times every 2 weeks. The total weekly volume per muscle ends up comparable to conventional programs, but the frequency and intensity distribution are radically different.

The program has three pillars: (1) rest-pause sets that compress maximum intensity into minimum sets, (2) exercise rotation that prevents staleness and forces progressive overload, and (3) extreme stretching that Trudel believes expands the fascia surrounding the muscle. Whether fascial stretching actually drives hypertrophy is debated, but the rest-pause and progressive overload components are well-supported by training science.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Advanced (2-3+ years of consistent, serious training). You need a solid strength base and the ability to push to true muscular failure safely on compound movements.
- **Prerequisites**: Comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}] at intermediate-level loads. Must know proper form on all exercises since you'll be pushing to failure repeatedly.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy with strength as a secondary benefit.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance. The high intensity combined with Trudel's recommendation of 1.5-2g protein per pound bodyweight makes this a poor choice for a cut.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Sessions take 45-60 minutes including warm-ups and stretching — one of the shortest bodybuilding programs available
- Each muscle group trained 3 times per 2 weeks (every 4-5 days), which is superior to once-per-week training for hypertrophy
- Rest-pause protocol forces genuine failure, eliminating "junk volume" — every rep counts
- Exercise rotation every session prevents accommodation and forces you to track and beat your logbook numbers from 2 weeks ago
- The logbook-driven approach makes progressive overload concrete and measurable rather than subjective

**Cons**

- Training to failure on every working set carries higher injury risk, especially as weights get heavy — requires excellent form discipline
- Rest-pause [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] are unsafe; the program uses straight sets for these, but widowmaker squats (20 reps) are still extremely demanding
- The exercise rotation means you only perform each specific exercise once every 2 weeks, which some lifters find insufficient for technique refinement on complex lifts
- No direct lateral delt work in the standard template — [{Overhead Press}] provides some stimulus, but lifters who want capped shoulders should add [{Lateral Raise}] as accessory work
- Requires the mental toughness to push to failure 3 times within a single set — many lifters stop 2-3 reps short of true failure without realizing it

## Program Structure

- **Split**: 2-way body part split — Workout A (chest, shoulders, triceps, back width, back thickness) and Workout B (biceps, forearms, calves, hamstrings, quads)
- **Periodization**: Auto-regulated progressive overload — beat your logbook from 2 weeks ago or swap the exercise
- **Schedule**: Rotating — A, B, A, B, A, B across Mon/Wed/Fri, with 3 different exercises per body part creating a 6-workout cycle that repeats every 2 weeks
- **Typical 2-week cycle**: Week 1 = A1, B1, A2. Week 2 = B2, A3, B3. Then repeat.

Each "A" workout trains the same body parts (chest, shoulders, triceps, back width, back thickness) but uses a different exercise for each. Same for "B" workouts (biceps, forearms, calves, hamstrings, quads). This means you perform 3 distinct exercises for each muscle group over the 2-week cycle, one per session.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

DC Training emphasizes compound movements that allow heavy loading and safe rest-pause execution. Trudel recommends choosing exercises where you can push hard without injury risk from fatigue-induced form breakdown.

**Chest** rotates through [{Bench Press}], [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], and [{Chest Dip}] — three different pressing angles that collectively develop the entire pectoralis major. [{Chest Dip}] allows deep stretch at the bottom, which aligns with Trudel's emphasis on loaded stretching.

**Shoulders** rotates [{Overhead Press}], [{Seated Overhead Press}], and [{Overhead Press, Dumbbell}] — three overhead pressing variations. DC Training relies on heavy pressing for shoulder development rather than isolation work.

**Triceps** rotates [{Skullcrusher}], [{Triceps Extension, Cable}], and [{Bench Press Close Grip}] — covering the long head (skullcrushers), lateral head (pushdowns), and overall mass (close-grip bench). [{Bench Press Close Grip}] is not rest-paused since it's a heavy compound.

**Back Width** rotates [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Chin Up}], and [{Pull Up}] — all vertical pulling movements targeting the lats. [{Chin Up}] and [{Pull Up}] use bodyweight plus added weight as you progress.

**Back Thickness** uses [{Bent Over Row}], [{T Bar Row}], and [{Deadlift}] — heavy horizontal pulls and hip hinges. These are NOT rest-paused due to the injury risk from form breakdown under fatigue. Instead, they use straight sets: one heavy set of 6-8 reps plus one set of 10-12 reps at slightly lower weight.

**Biceps** rotates [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}], [{Hammer Curl}], and [{Preacher Curl, EZ Bar}] — standard curling variations with different grip positions and force curves. Rest-paused with a wider rep range (11-20 total).

**Forearms** rotates [{Wrist Curl}], [{Reverse Wrist Curl}], and [{Hammer Curl, Cable}] — direct forearm flexion, extension, and brachioradialis work.

**Calves** rotates [{Standing Calf Raise}], [{Seated Calf Raise}], and [{Calf Press on Leg Press}] — covering gastrocnemius (straight knee) and soleus (bent knee). These use the DC-specific calf protocol: 10-12 reps with a 5-second negative and 10-15 second pause at full stretch on each rep.

**Hamstrings** rotates [{Lying Leg Curl}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], and [{Seated Leg Curl}] — machine curls for isolation and stiff-leg deadlifts for stretch-mediated hypertrophy. Rest-paused with a wider rep range (15-30 total).

**Quads** rotates [{Squat}], [{Hack Squat}], and [{Leg Press}] — all heavy compound quad-dominant movements. These are NOT rest-paused. Instead, you do one heavy straight set of 4-8 reps, rest, then perform the infamous "widowmaker" — a 20-rep set with reduced weight that is as brutal as it sounds.

**Substitution options**: Any exercise can be swapped for another that targets the same muscle from a similar angle. The key constraint is that rest-pause exercises must be safe to push to failure on — avoid exercises with high injury risk at failure (e.g., barbell back squats for rest-pause).

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Rest-pause exercises** (chest, shoulders, triceps, back width): Target 11-15 total reps across 3 mini-sets to failure with 20-30 seconds rest (15 deep breaths) between each. A typical breakdown might be 8+4+2 or 7+3+2 reps.
- **Biceps/forearms**: Rest-pause with 11-20 total reps — higher range because lighter loads allow more reps before failure.
- **Hamstrings**: Rest-pause with 15-30 total reps — even higher range due to lighter relative loading on leg curls.
- **Back thickness**: Two straight sets — one heavy set of 6-8 reps, one set of 10-12 reps at slightly lower weight. No rest-pause.
- **Quads**: One heavy straight set of 4-8 reps, then one widowmaker set of 20 reps at reduced weight. No rest-pause.
- **Calves**: One set of 10-12 reps with controlled tempo — 5-second negative, 10-15 second pause at full stretch, explosive positive. No rest-pause.

All rest-pause exercises use a controlled negative of 4-6 seconds on every rep. This is critical to the DC protocol — fast, bouncy reps defeat the purpose.

## Progressive Overload

**Every session, you must beat your logbook from 2 weeks ago** — either more reps at the same weight or the same reps at more weight, even if only by 5lb or 1 rep. This is the fundamental driver of DC Training.

- **Success**: Add weight (5lb upper body, 5-10lb lower body) or reps next time you perform that exercise (2 weeks later).
- **Failure to progress**: If you fail to beat your logbook for 2 consecutive sessions of the same exercise (4 weeks apart), remove that exercise from your rotation and replace it with a different movement for that body part.
- **Blast phase**: Train with full intensity for 6-8 weeks. Advanced lifters may push to 10-12 weeks if recovery is managed.
- **Cruise phase**: After blasting, take 10-14 days of low-intensity maintenance training — reduce to 2 sessions per week with straight sets (no rest-pause), no failure, and reduced volume. Then begin a new blast.

This implementation uses double progression: within the target rep range, once you hit the top of the range on all mini-sets combined, weight increases by 5lb and reps reset to the bottom of the range.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run DC Training in **blast/cruise cycles** for as long as you're making progress — many advanced lifters stay on the system for years. Each blast phase should be 6-8 weeks followed by a 10-14 day cruise.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You can't beat your logbook on most exercises despite swapping movements, you're accumulating joint pain from repeated failure training, or you want to focus on pure strength or powerlifting-style training.

**Transition to**: [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) if you want structured periodization with sub-maximal training. [PHUL](/programs/phul) if you want an upper/lower split with both power and hypertrophy days. A traditional PPL split like [Metallicadpa PPL](/programs/metallicadpappl) if you want higher volume with more moderate intensity.

## Equipment Needed

- **Barbell and plates** — for bench press, overhead press, squat, deadlift, bent over row, skullcrusher, stiff leg deadlift, barbell curl, close-grip bench, wrist curls
- **Dumbbells** — for incline dumbbell press, dumbbell overhead press, hammer curls
- **Cable machine** — for cable triceps extension, hammer curl cable, reverse wrist curl
- **Pull-up bar** — for chin-ups and pull-ups
- **Leg press or hack squat machine** — for quad rotation and calf press
- **Leg curl machine** — for lying leg curl and seated leg curl

**Free-weight substitutions**: [{Lat Pulldown}] can be replaced with [{Chin Up}] (already in rotation). [{Leg Press}] can be replaced with [{Front Squat}]. [{Lying Leg Curl}] can be replaced with [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}]. [{Calf Press on Leg Press}] can be replaced with [{Standing Calf Raise, Barbell}].

## Rest Times

- **Rest-pause mini-sets**: 20-30 seconds (15 deep breaths) between the 3 mini-sets within a rest-pause set
- **Between exercises**: 2-3 minutes (use this time for extreme stretching of the muscle just trained)
- **Back thickness straight sets**: 2-3 minutes between the 2 sets
- **Quad widowmaker**: 3-5 minutes between the heavy set and the 20-rep set
- **Calves**: No rest between reps in the traditional sense — the 10-15 second stretch pause at the bottom IS the rest

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**Rest-pause exercises**: Pick a weight where you can get 7-8 reps to failure on the first mini-set. If you can get more than 10 on the first mini-set, it's too light. If you get fewer than 5, it's too heavy. The total across all 3 mini-sets should land in the 11-15 range.

**Quads (heavy set)**: Use approximately 80-85% of your 1RM for the 4-8 rep set. For the widowmaker, use approximately 50-60% of your 1RM — this will feel deceptively light until rep 12.

**Back thickness**: Use a weight that allows 6-8 hard reps on the first set, then reduce by 10-20% for the 10-12 rep set.

**Common mistake**: Starting too heavy on rest-pause sets. The controlled 4-6 second negatives dramatically reduce how much weight you can handle compared to regular sets. Drop your normal working weight by 15-20% for your first DC session.

## Common Modifications

- **Add lateral raises**: The standard DC template has no direct lateral delt work. Add [{Lateral Raise}] (3x10-15) at the end of "A" workouts if shoulder width is a priority.
- **Swap forearm work for rear delts**: Replace forearm exercises with [{Face Pull}] or [{Reverse Fly}] if rear delts are a weakness and forearms grow sufficiently from heavy pulling.
- **4-day split**: Some lifters run DC on a Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri schedule, splitting A workouts into upper push (chest/shoulders/triceps) and upper pull (back width/thickness), and splitting B workouts into arms (biceps/forearms) and legs (calves/hamstrings/quads). This shortens sessions to ~35 minutes.
- **Skip widowmakers**: If 20-rep squats are too dangerous or you have back issues, replace the widowmaker with a second heavy set of 8-12 reps. You lose the metabolic stress stimulus but retain the mechanical tension.
- **Add a static hold**: Advanced DC trainees add a 30-60 second isometric hold at the end of the rest-pause set on pressing movements — hold the weight at the most mechanically disadvantaged position. This is optional and only for very experienced lifters.

### Is DoggCrapp training good for beginners?

No. DC Training is explicitly designed for advanced lifters with at least 2-3 years of serious training experience. Beginners lack the ability to push to true muscular failure safely, don't have the mind-muscle connection to benefit from rest-pause intensity, and will make faster progress on a simpler program with more volume and practice on the basic lifts.

### How many days a week is DC Training?

DC Training is 3 days per week, typically Monday/Wednesday/Friday. You alternate between two workout types (A and B) with a different exercise for each body part each session, creating a 6-workout rotation that repeats every 2 weeks. Each muscle group gets trained 3 times every 2 weeks.

### What is a rest-pause set in DoggCrapp?

A rest-pause set involves performing one set to failure, resting 20-30 seconds (15 deep breaths), doing another set to failure with the same weight, resting again, and doing a final set to failure. The goal is 11-15 total reps across the 3 mini-sets (e.g., 8+4+2 reps). This is the only working set for that body part in that session.

### What is a widowmaker set in DC Training?

A widowmaker is a 20-rep set of squats (or leg press/hack squat) performed after a heavy set of 4-8 reps. The weight is reduced but still heavy enough to make the last 5-8 reps excruciating. Trudel considers this the single most growth-producing element of the program for quads.

### How long should I run DoggCrapp training?

DC Training uses blast and cruise cycles. Blast (full intensity) for 6-8 weeks, then cruise (low volume, no failure) for 10-14 days. Repeat this cycle for as long as you're making progress. Many advanced lifters run DC for years across multiple blast/cruise cycles.

### Can I add more exercises to DC Training?

Trudel strongly advises against adding volume. The program is intentionally low-volume and high-intensity — adding sets or exercises dilutes the intensity that makes DC work. If you feel you have energy left after a DC session, you probably aren't pushing hard enough on your rest-pause sets. The only commonly accepted addition is lateral raises for shoulder width.

### What is extreme stretching in DoggCrapp?

Extreme stretching involves holding an intense, loaded stretch for 60-90 seconds on each muscle group immediately after training it. For example, after chest you hold heavy dumbbells in a deep fly stretch position. Trudel believes this expands the fascia to allow more muscle growth. While the fascia-stretching theory is debated, the stretches serve as useful active recovery between exercises.

### How do I know if I'm training hard enough for DC Training?

If your rest-pause sets don't leave you gasping and slightly dizzy, you're not pushing to true failure. The first mini-set should end when you physically cannot complete another rep with proper form. The second mini-set after 15 breaths should yield roughly half the reps of the first. The third mini-set should be 1-3 reps at most. If you're getting 5+ reps on the third mini-set, the weight is too light.
