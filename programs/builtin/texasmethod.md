A 3-day full-body intermediate program that compresses an entire volume-recovery-intensity mesocycle into a single week. Created by Mark Rippetoe and Glenn Pendlay, it's the go-to "next step" for lifters who can no longer add weight every session on programs like Starting Strength or StrongLifts.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Texas Method was born when Olympic weightlifting coach Glenn Pendlay made a deal with one of his athletes at the Wichita Falls Athletic Club: hit a new 5-rep PR and you can skip the remaining 4 sets. The athlete did, and the seed of the program was planted. Mark Rippetoe refined this into a complete system and published it in [Practical Programming for Strength Training](https://aasgaardco.com/store/books-702230/practical-programming-for-strength-training-3rd-edition/).

The core insight: intermediate lifters can't recover from max-effort training every 48 hours like beginners can. Instead of progressing every session, the Texas Method spreads the stress-recovery-adaptation cycle across an entire week. Monday provides the volume stimulus, Wednesday allows active recovery, and Friday is where you cash in with a new PR.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (12-24+ months of consistent barbell training). You should have completed a novice linear progression program like Starting Strength, StrongLifts 5x5, or [Phrak's Greyskull LP](/programs/phrakgreyskull).
- **Prerequisites**: Comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Clean}] technique. Approximate minimums: 1.25x bodyweight squat, 0.85x bodyweight bench.
- **Primary goal**: Strength — this is a peaking-style program, not a hypertrophy program.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance. Running it on a caloric deficit will make recovery extremely difficult. Rippetoe recommends eating in a 200-300 calorie surplus and sleeping 8+ hours.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Squats 3x per week at varying intensities, which builds technique faster than programs that squat 1-2x/week
- Weekly PRs on Intensity Day provide clear, measurable progress and psychological motivation
- Simple structure — only 3 exercises per day, no complex percentage schemes to track
- Full-body training 3x/week fits a Mon/Wed/Fri schedule cleanly
- The Volume → Recovery → Intensity structure teaches lifters how stress/recovery/adaptation actually works

**Cons**

- Volume Day is brutally long — 5x5 [{Squat}] followed by 5x5 [{Bench Press}] or [{Overhead Press}] can take 90+ minutes with proper rest
- [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] only get a PR attempt every 2 weeks each (they alternate), which slows upper body progress
- No direct lateral delt, hamstring isolation, or ab work — you need to add your own if those are priorities
- Recovery Day can feel pointless — experienced lifters often want to push harder than the program allows
- Deadlift volume is minimal (1 set per week) — lifters whose deadlift is a weak point may need more

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, 3 days per week
- **Periodization**: Weekly undulating — Volume (high stress) → Recovery (low stress) → Intensity (peak)
- **Schedule**: Fixed Mon/Wed/Fri
- **Cycle length**: 2-week repeating cycle (Bench and OHP alternate weeks)
- **Typical Week 1**: Volume Day (Squat + Bench + Deadlift) → Recovery Day (Squat + OHP + Chin-ups) → Intensity Day (Squat + Bench + Cleans)
- **Typical Week 2**: Volume Day (Squat + OHP + Deadlift) → Recovery Day (Squat + Bench + Chin-ups) → Intensity Day (Squat + OHP + Cleans)

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Volume Day** opens with [{Squat}] 5x5 — the primary driver of the whole program. [{Bench Press}] or [{Overhead Press}] (alternating weeks) follows as the upper body volume work. [{Deadlift}] closes the session with a single heavy set of 5, since the posterior chain is already heavily taxed from squats. [{Bicep Curl}] is optional direct arm work.

**Recovery Day** uses [{Squat}] at reduced weight and volume (2x5 at ~80% of Volume Day weight) to maintain movement quality without impeding recovery. The press that was NOT used on Volume Day gets moderate work at 3x5. [{Chin Up}] provides back and bicep volume with minimal systemic fatigue. [{Back Extension, Bodyweight}] maintains posterior chain health.

**Intensity Day** is the payoff. [{Squat}] is a single set of 5 at or above last week's PR — this is the primary measure of progress. The matching press gets the same treatment. [{Clean}] at 5x3 develops explosive power and posterior chain strength without the recovery cost of heavy deadlifts.

**Substitutions**: [{Clean}] can be replaced with [{Deficit Deadlift}], paused deadlifts, or [{Sumo Deadlift}] if you can't perform cleans. [{Chin Up}] can be swapped for [{Pull Up}] or [{Bent Over Row}].

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Volume Day compounds** ([{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}]): 5x5 at ~90% of 5RM (~77% of 1RM). High total volume (25 reps) at moderate intensity drives the adaptation stimulus for the week.
- **Recovery Day compounds**: [{Squat}] 2x5 at ~80% of Volume Day weight (~62% of 1RM). The alternate press gets 3x5 at ~70% of 1RM. Light enough to maintain technique without creating meaningful fatigue.
- **Intensity Day compounds**: [{Squat}] and press 1x5 at a new 5RM (~85% of 1RM). This is the peak effort — one all-out set where you try to beat last week's weight.
- **Volume Day [{Deadlift}]**: 1x5 at ~77% of 1RM. Only one set because you're already fatigued from squats.
- **Intensity Day [{Clean}]**: 5x3 at ~70% of 1RM. Triples keep the weight moderate while focusing on explosiveness.
- **[{Chin Up}]**: 3 sets to failure (AMRAP). Rippetoe prescribes 5 minutes rest between sets.
- **[{Back Extension, Bodyweight}]**: 5x10. Light, high-rep posterior chain work.

## Progressive Overload

The Texas Method uses **weekly linear progression** — you add weight to your Intensity Day lifts every week.

**When you succeed on Intensity Day**: The 1RM for that lift increases by 5lb. This cascades to all days — Volume Day and Recovery Day weights automatically adjust proportionally for the next cycle.

**Weekly increases**: ~5lb on [{Squat}] per week, ~5lb on [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] per PR session (every 2 weeks each, since they alternate). [{Deadlift}] increases 5lb per week independently.

**When you stall on Intensity Day**: Several options in order of preference:
1. **Cut Monday volume** — drop from 5x5 to 4x5 or 3x5 to reduce accumulated fatigue
2. **Reduce Monday weight** — drop Volume Day intensity by 5-10% and rebuild
3. **Cycle rep ranges on Intensity Day** — shift from 1x5 to 2x3, then 3x2, then 5x1, then reset to 1x5 at a new weight
4. **Take a deload week** — use 50% of normal weights for one week, then resume

**When you stall on Volume Day**: Your Monday workload is too high. Drop a set or two, reduce the weight by 5-10%, or reduce reps per set.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the Texas Method for **3-6 months**. Some lifters get 6-12+ months out of it with modifications, but the basic version has a finite lifespan.

**Signs it's time to move on**: Friday PRs require cycling through triples and doubles frequently, Volume Day takes 2+ hours and you dread it, or you've stalled and reset multiple times.

**Transition to**: A more advanced intermediate/early advanced program. The [Barbell Medicine](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/12-ways-to-skin-the-texas-method/) variants extend the Texas Method's life. Beyond that, [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b) (monthly progression), [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) (tiered approach with more volume), or [Madcow 5x5](/programs/madcow) (ramped sets with weekly progression) are natural next steps.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, squat rack, bench, and weight plates. That's the core.

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Clean}] → [{Deadlift}] (lighter, for 5x3) or [{Kettlebell Swing}]
- [{Back Extension, Bodyweight}] → [{Good Morning}] or [{Romanian Deadlift}] (light weight, high reps)
- [{Chin Up}] → [{Bent Over Row}] or [{Inverted Row}] if no pull-up bar

## Rest Times

- **Volume Day compounds**: **3-5 minutes** between sets. The 5x5 squats are grueling — take what you need, but Rippetoe suggests capping at 8-10 minutes.
- **Recovery Day**: **2 minutes** between sets. These should feel manageable.
- **Intensity Day main lifts**: **5 minutes** before the PR set. Work up gradually through warmup singles/doubles.
- **Intensity Day [{Clean}]**: **2 minutes** between sets.
- **Accessories**: **60-90 seconds**.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**If you know your 5RM** (from your previous program): Volume Day weight is 90% of your 5RM. Intensity Day starts AT your current 5RM.

**If you know your 1RM**: The program uses these percentages — Volume Day at 77%, Recovery Day squat at 62%, Recovery Day press at 70%, Intensity Day at 85%.

**If you don't know either**: Use your last working weight from your novice program. If you were squatting 225lb for 3x5 on Starting Strength, start Volume Day at ~205lb (5x5) and Intensity Day at ~230lb (1x5).

**Common mistake**: Starting Volume Day too heavy. The 5x5 needs to be completable with good form — if you're grinding reps on set 3, the weight is too high. Start conservatively and let the weekly progression bring you up.

## Common Modifications

- **4-day split**: Move [{Deadlift}] from Volume Day to Recovery Day (performed first, before light squats) to improve deadlift quality. Or split Volume Day across two sessions (squats on one day, pressing on another).
- **Replace [{Clean}] on Intensity Day**: Many lifters use [{Deadlift}] (1x5, heavier than Volume Day) or a deadlift variation ([{Deficit Deadlift}], [{Sumo Deadlift}]) instead.
- **Undulating periodization**: Alternate between 5x5 and 5x3 on Volume Day week-to-week to manage fatigue accumulation.
- **Add rear delts/abs**: Tack [{Face Pull}] (3x15-20) onto upper body days and [{Hanging Leg Raise}] (3x10-15) onto lower body days.
- **More arm work**: Add [{Triceps Extension}] or [{Skullcrusher}] on Volume Day alongside the bicep curls.
- **Bench emphasis**: If preparing for a meet, run [{Bench Press}] on both Volume and Intensity days every week (dropping the alternation with OHP). Keep [{Overhead Press}] on Recovery Day only.

<!-- faq -->

### Is the Texas Method good for beginners?

No, the Texas Method is an intermediate program designed for lifters who have completed a novice linear progression like Starting Strength or StrongLifts 5x5. You should have 12-24+ months of consistent barbell training before starting.

### How many days a week is the Texas Method?

It's a 3-day program trained Monday/Wednesday/Friday. Monday is Volume Day (5x5), Wednesday is Recovery Day (light work), and Friday is Intensity Day (1x5 PR attempt).

### How does progression work on the Texas Method?

The Texas Method uses weekly linear progression. When you hit your Intensity Day PR (1x5), your 1RM increases by 5lb, which shifts all Volume and Recovery Day weights up proportionally for the next cycle.

### What do I do when I stall on the Texas Method?

First try cutting Monday volume from 5x5 to 4x5 or 3x5. If that doesn't work, reduce Monday weight by 5-10% and rebuild. You can also cycle Intensity Day rep ranges — shift from 1x5 to 2x3, then 3x2, then 5x1, then reset.

### How long should I run the Texas Method?

Run it for 3-6 months. Some lifters get 6-12+ months with modifications, but the basic version has a finite lifespan. Move on when Friday PRs require frequent cycling through triples and doubles or when Volume Day takes 2+ hours.

### Can I replace power cleans in the Texas Method?

Yes. Many lifters use a deadlift variation (deficit deadlifts, sumo deadlifts) or a heavier deadlift set on Intensity Day instead of cleans. Cleans develop explosive power that deadlifts don't, but the substitution works fine for general strength development.
