Jim Wendler's most demanding 5/3/1 template — a 6-week mass-building block that pairs heavy 5/3/1 barbell work with extreme accessory volume (100+ reps of chin-ups, dips, and face pulls) and weekly widowmaker squat sets of 20 reps. Requires eating 1.5 lbs of ground beef and a dozen eggs daily. Not for the faint of heart.

## Origin & Philosophy

Building the Monolith (BtM) was created by [Jim Wendler](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size) as a finite 6-week hypertrophy block built on his 5/3/1 framework. Wendler — a former Westside Barbell lifter who squatted 1,000 lbs — designed it for lifters who were already strong but needed to get bigger.

The philosophy: combine heavy barbell work with extreme training volume and aggressive eating. Wendler mandates eating 1.5 lbs of ground beef and 12 whole eggs daily (~5,000+ calories). The program punishes you if you don't eat enough — you'll either grow or break. The name references Conan the Barbarian's approach to building something massive through relentless effort.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (2+ years). You need solid technique on all four main barbell lifts because you'll be squatting heavy 3 days per week, including a 20-rep widowmaker set.
- **Prerequisites**: Comfortable with high-rep squatting. Able to do bodyweight [{Chin Up}]s and [{Chest Dip}]s for multiple sets — Wendler recommends being able to accumulate 50+ dips and 50+ chin-ups in a session before starting.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy with strength maintenance. Users commonly report 10-15 lbs of bodyweight gain and noticeable size increases in back, shoulders, arms, and quads over the 6 weeks.
- **Best suited for**: Aggressive bulking only. The extreme volume and mandated caloric intake make this incompatible with cutting or maintenance.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- One of the most effective short-term mass-building programs — 6 weeks of commitment produces visible results in back, shoulders, arms, and quads
- [{Squat}] trained 3x/week (heavy 5x5 Monday, ramp-up Wednesday via [{Deadlift}] day, widowmaker Friday) drives rapid leg growth
- 100-rep accessory sets for [{Chin Up}]s, [{Chest Dip}]s, and [{Face Pull}]s build serious upper body size without complicated exercise selection
- Only 3 training days per week, leaving room for conditioning and recovery
- Finite 6-week duration provides a clear endpoint — you can push harder knowing it's temporary

**Cons**

- Sessions run 90-120+ minutes due to sheer volume — the 100-rep accessory sets alone take 15-20 minutes each
- Recovery demands are extreme — requires ~5,000+ calories daily, quality sleep, and 3-4 conditioning sessions per week
- The 20-rep widowmaker squat sets are mentally and physically brutal, especially in weeks 5-6 when the weight reaches 55-60% of 1RM
- Not suitable for cutting, maintenance, or anyone unwilling to commit to aggressive eating
- No direct hamstring or glute isolation — the program assumes [{Deadlift}] and [{Squat}] volume is sufficient for posterior chain development

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body with emphasis rotation — [{Squat}] + [{Overhead Press}] on Monday and Friday, [{Deadlift}] + [{Bench Press}] on Wednesday
- **Periodization**: Two 3-week waves with a Training Max increase between them. Within each wave, intensity follows a medium/light/heavy pattern (not the standard 5/3/1 ascending order)
- **Schedule**: Fixed Mon/Wed/Fri. Conditioning is mandatory on Tue/Thu/Sat (prowler sprints, weighted vest walks, or stationary bike)
- **Unique features**: Monday [{Overhead Press}] includes an AMRAP back-off set. Friday has a 20-rep widowmaker [{Squat}] and high-volume [{Overhead Press}] (10-15 sets of 5)

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Main lifts** rotate across three training days:

- **Monday** ([{Squat}] + [{Overhead Press}]): [{Squat}] gets the heaviest treatment with 5x5 at the top percentage. [{Overhead Press}] includes an AMRAP back-off set at the lowest percentage for volume and auto-regulation.
- **Wednesday** ([{Deadlift}] + [{Bench Press}]): [{Deadlift}] uses fewer top sets (3x5 vs 5x5) because of its higher systemic fatigue. [{Bench Press}] gets the full 5x5 treatment.
- **Friday** ([{Squat}] + [{Overhead Press}] volume): [{Squat}] ramps to a single heavy set then drops to a 20-rep widowmaker — the defining feature of the program. [{Overhead Press}] gets high-set volume (10-15 sets of 5) at moderate weight.

**Accessories** are chosen for high-rep accumulation:

- [{Chin Up}] (Monday: 100 bodyweight reps; Friday: 5x5 weighted): Vertical pulling to balance pressing volume and build back width.
- [{Chest Dip}] (Monday: 150 reps): Upper body pressing volume that complements [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}].
- [{Face Pull}] (Monday and Friday: 100 reps each): Rear delt and upper back health to counterbalance heavy pressing. Band pull-aparts can substitute.
- [{Bent Over One Arm Row}] (Wednesday: 5x10-20): Heavy horizontal pulling for back thickness.
- [{Bicep Curl}] (Wednesday: 100 reps): Direct arm work — the only isolation exercise in the program.
- [{Shrug}] (Friday: 100 reps): Trap development to support heavy barbell work.

All accessories can be swapped for similar movements — e.g., [{Pull Up}] for [{Chin Up}], [{Triceps Dip}] for [{Chest Dip}], [{Bent Over Row}] for [{Bent Over One Arm Row}].

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Main lifts** follow the 5/3/1 wave pattern, but all working sets stay at 5 reps (no 3s or 1s weeks). Percentages are based on a Training Max (TM) of 85% of 1RM. In this Liftosaur implementation, percentages are expressed as **% of 1RM directly** (pre-converted from TM):

- **Weeks 1 and 4 (Medium)**: Warm-up sets at 60% and 68%, top sets at 76% of 1RM
- **Weeks 2 and 5 (Light)**: Warm-up sets at 55% and 64%, top sets at 72% of 1RM
- **Weeks 3 and 6 (Heavy)**: Warm-up sets at 64% and 72%, top sets at 80% of 1RM

[{Squat}] gets the most volume: 7 working sets on Monday (1x5, 1x5, 5x5 at top weight) and 3 ramp-up sets + 1x20 widowmaker on Friday. [{Deadlift}] gets fewer top sets (3x5 instead of 5x5) due to systemic fatigue. [{Bench Press}] mirrors [{Squat}]'s 5x5 structure. [{Overhead Press}] has 3 working sets plus an AMRAP back-off set on Monday, and 10-15 sets of 5 on Friday.

The AMRAP set on Monday [{Overhead Press}] provides auto-regulation — don't push to absolute failure, stop with 1-2 reps in reserve. Wendler says not to chase rep PRs in the first 3-week wave; save that for the second wave.

**Widowmaker [{Squat}]** (Friday): 1 set of 20 reps, climbing from ~40% to 60% of 1RM over the 6 weeks. Do not re-rack the bar during these 20 reps — rest-pause at the top position (standing with the bar on your back) is acceptable.

**Accessories**: 100+ total reps broken into as many sets as needed. For bodyweight [{Chin Up}]s and [{Chest Dip}]s, this might be 10x10, 5x20, or any combination.

## Progressive Overload

The program uses two 3-week waves with a Training Max increase between them:

- **Weeks 1-3**: First wave at your starting weights
- **After Week 3**: 1RM increases by +5 lbs for [{Overhead Press}] and [{Bench Press}], +10 lbs for [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}]
- **Weeks 4-6**: Second wave at the new weights — same percentage pattern but applied to the higher 1RM

There is no failure-based deload. The program is designed to be completed as written over exactly 6 weeks, with the weights being manageable if your Training Max is set correctly.

**If you can't complete the prescribed sets**: Your TM is too high. Wendler specifically recommends TM at 85% of true 1RM for this program (lower than the 90% used in other 5/3/1 templates). Start conservatively — finishing all 6 weeks matters more than impressing yourself in week 1.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run Building the Monolith for **exactly 6 weeks**. Do NOT repeat it immediately. Take a deload week, then transition to a less demanding template.

**Signs it's working**: Bodyweight is climbing, clothes fit tighter in shoulders and thighs, widowmaker squat weight is increasing each week.

**What next**: **5/3/1 Boring But Big** (similar philosophy but sustainable long-term), **5/3/1 First Set Last** (lower volume for recovery), or any standard 5/3/1 template. Wendler specifically warns against jumping into another extreme block immediately.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, squat rack, bench, weight plates, a pull-up/chin-up bar, and dumbbells for rows and curls. A cable machine for [{Face Pull}]s is ideal but not required.

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Face Pull}] → [{Reverse Fly}] with dumbbells, or band pull-aparts
- [{Bent Over One Arm Row}] → [{Bent Over Row}] with barbell
- [{Bicep Curl}] → [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] with straight bar or EZ bar
- [{Shrug}] → [{Shrug, Barbell}]
- [{Chest Dip}] → [{Push Up}] with a weight vest if dip station unavailable
- [{Chin Up}] (weighted on Friday) → [{Chin Up}] with a dumbbell between feet or a dip belt

## Rest Times

- **Main compound sets** ([{Squat}] 5x5, [{Bench Press}] 5x5, [{Deadlift}] 3x5): **3-5 minutes** between working sets
- **Friday [{Overhead Press}]** (10-15 sets of 5): **60-90 seconds** — keep these moving at the prescribed moderate weights
- **Widowmaker [{Squat}]**: Rest as long as needed before starting. Perform it last on Friday.
- **100-rep accessories** ([{Chin Up}], [{Chest Dip}], [{Face Pull}], [{Bicep Curl}], [{Shrug}]): **60-90 seconds** between sets. Can be supersetted (e.g., [{Face Pull}]s between [{Chin Up}] sets) to save time. Do NOT superset main compound lifts.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

1. For each main lift ([{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}]), estimate or test your **1 Rep Max** (1RM). This Liftosaur implementation uses 1RM directly — all working percentages are pre-converted from Wendler's TM-based percentages (assuming TM = 85% of 1RM).
2. Set your 1RM in the app and all weights calculate automatically.

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Work up to a weight you can do for 3-5 clean reps. Use Brzycki's formula: 1RM = weight / (1.0278 - 0.0278 × reps). Or use the Liftosaur 1RM calculator.

**Common mistake**: Setting your 1RM too high. Wendler uses a lower TM (85% vs the usual 90%) for this program specifically because the volume is so high. If your Week 3 heavy sets at 80% of 1RM feel like absolute grinders, your 1RM is inflated — lower it by 5-10%.

**Accessories**: [{Chin Up}]s and [{Chest Dip}]s are bodyweight. For [{Face Pull}]s, [{Bicep Curl}]s, [{Shrug}]s, and [{Bent Over One Arm Row}]s, start with a moderate weight that lets you accumulate the total reps without individual sets going to failure.

## Common Modifications

- **Reduced dip volume**: If 150 dips is too much for your shoulders, start at 50-75 and add 10-15 per week. [{Push Up}]s can substitute if dips cause joint pain.
- **Safety squat bar for widowmakers**: Wendler suggests using an SSB for the 20-rep set if available — reduces upper back fatigue and lets you focus on leg drive.
- **Conditioning**: Wendler mandates 3-4 conditioning sessions per week on off-days. Prowler sprints (10 x 40 yards), weighted vest walks (2 miles at ~80 lbs), and stationary bike (10 miles at moderate pace). Hill sprints are NOT recommended — too taxing alongside this training volume.
- **Older lifters**: Wendler recommends reducing widowmaker percentages by 5-10% and being more conservative with the TM.
- **No joker sets**: Wendler explicitly forbids joker sets in this program — a test subject tried them on [{Deadlift}] and nearly had to abandon the program.
- **No added exercises**: Run the program as written. Do not combine with Olympic lifts or add extra work beyond the prescribed conditioning.

### Is 5/3/1 Building the Monolith good for beginners?

No, Building the Monolith is an intermediate to advanced program requiring 2+ years of training experience. You need to be able to accumulate 50+ chin-ups and 50+ dips in a single session before starting. Try 5/3/1 for Beginners or Boring But Big first.

### How many days a week is Building the Monolith?

It's a 3-day lifting program (Monday/Wednesday/Friday) with mandatory conditioning on 3-4 off-days. Sessions run 90-120+ minutes due to the extreme accessory volume — 100+ reps each of chin-ups, dips, face pulls, and other exercises.

### How long is the Building the Monolith program?

It's exactly 6 weeks — two 3-week waves with a Training Max increase between them. Do not repeat it immediately. Take a deload week afterward, then transition to a less demanding 5/3/1 template.

### What are the diet requirements for Building the Monolith?

Wendler mandates eating 1.5 lbs of ground beef and 12 whole eggs daily, which works out to roughly 5,000+ calories. The program punishes you if you don't eat enough — the extreme volume and 20-rep squat sets are only recoverable with aggressive caloric surplus.

### What is the widowmaker squat set in Building the Monolith?

Every Friday includes one set of 20 reps of squats, climbing from about 40% to 60% of 1RM over the 6 weeks. You don't re-rack the bar during the 20 reps — rest-pause at the top position is acceptable. It's the defining and most brutal feature of the program.

### What should I do after Building the Monolith?

Transition to 5/3/1 Boring But Big (similar philosophy but sustainable long-term), 5/3/1 First Set Last (lower volume for recovery), or any standard 5/3/1 template. Wendler specifically warns against jumping into another extreme block immediately.
