The Calgary Barbell 16-Week program is one of the most popular free powerlifting peaking programs available. Created by Bryce Krawczyk, it uses a hybrid percentage/RPE system across 4 training days per week with high bench frequency (4x/week), preparing lifters for competition or a gym 1RM test through four distinct training phases.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Calgary Barbell 16-Week program was created by **Bryce Krawczyk**, a Canadian powerlifter who has competed at the highest levels of drug-tested powerlifting — making the podium at IPF Worlds both raw and equipped, and breaking deadlift world records. The program is offered free through the [Calgary Barbell website](https://www.calgarybarbell.com/16-week-program).

The core philosophy is structured peaking through block periodization. The program transitions from higher-volume technique-focused work in the early weeks to heavy competition-specific singles in the final weeks. It uses a hybrid loading approach: earlier phases rely on fixed percentages of 1RM to build consistency, while later phases shift toward RPE-based prescriptions to allow lifters to push intensity based on daily readiness. This implementation uses the "Revised" version where all RPE prescriptions have been converted to approximate percentages for simplicity.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (6+ months of barbell training with established 1RMs on squat, bench, and deadlift)
- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with competition-style paused [{Bench Press}], [{Squat}], and [{Deadlift}] technique. Understanding of RPE is helpful but not required — this version uses percentages.
- **Primary goal**: Peaking maximal strength on the competition lifts for a meet or gym test
- **Best suited for**: Meet prep on a bulk or maintenance. Can be run without a meet, treating the final week as a gym max-out.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- High bench frequency (4x/week) with paused and touch-and-go variations drives rapid bench progress — users commonly report 15-25 lb bench PRs
- The 16-week length allows a full progression from volume through peaking, unlike shorter programs that rush the taper
- Exercise variation in early phases (pin squats, pause deadlifts, Spoto press) builds strength in weak positions while keeping training interesting
- Hybrid percentage/RPE system teaches lifters to autoregulate while providing concrete weight targets
- Free and battle-tested — thousands of lifters have used this program to set competition PRs

**Cons**

- Sessions take 75-90+ minutes due to high exercise count (5-6 movements per day) and heavy compound work
- No direct arm, calf, or lateral delt work — lifters wanting hypertrophy need to add their own accessories
- The program assumes access to a full gym setup — requires a barbell, rack, bench, and dumbbells at minimum
- Squat and deadlift variations (pin squat, pause deadlift) require familiarity — technique-sensitive movements at percentage-based loads can be tricky for less experienced lifters
- With 4 mandatory sessions per week, each lasting 75-90 minutes, the time commitment is significant

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Competition lift-focused, each day organized around a primary squat, bench, or deadlift movement with secondary pressing and pulling work
- **Periodization**: Block periodization with four phases — acclimation (weeks 1-4), intensification (weeks 5-8), peaking (weeks 9-12), and competition prep with taper (weeks 13-16)
- **Schedule**: Fixed 4-day weekly rotation. Day 1 is squat + bench focused, Day 2 is deadlift + bench, Day 3 is squat variation + bench variation, Day 4 is deadlift variation + bench.
- **Bench appears on all 4 days** in varying forms: competition paused bench, touch-and-go bench, Spoto press / close grip, and light technique work

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

The program centers on the three competition lifts ([{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}]) with strategic variations:

- **[{Squat}]** appears as competition squat (Day 1), [{Front Squat}] or high-bar pause squat (Day 2), and pin squat (Day 3). The variations address different weaknesses: front squats build quad strength and upright positioning, pin squats develop strength out of the hole.
- **[{Bench Press}]** appears 4x/week: paused competition bench (Days 1-2), Spoto press or close-grip bench (Day 3), and touch-and-go rep bench (Day 4). The high frequency is the program's signature feature — paused work builds competition-specific strength while touch-and-go builds volume.
- **[{Deadlift}]** appears as competition deadlift (Day 2), 2-count pause deadlift (Day 4), and optionally as deficit or block pulls. Pause deadlifts develop strength off the floor, the most common sticking point.
- **Accessories** include [{Overhead Press}] for shoulder strength, [{Bent Over Row}] and [{Bent Over One Arm Row}] for back development, and [{Back Extension}] for posterior chain endurance. These are prescribed at RPE-based loads (converted to moderate percentages in this version).

As the program progresses into weeks 9-16, variations are dropped and competition lifts dominate, with increasing singles practice.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Phase 1 — Acclimation (Weeks 1-4)**: Competition lifts start at 4x7 @ 67% and progress weekly — 4x6 @ 70%, 4x5 @ 73%, 4x4 @ 75%. Variations use 3x5-6 at slightly lower percentages. Accessories use 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps.

**Phase 2 — Intensification (Weeks 5-8)**: Main lifts shift to a top set + backoff structure. Top sets are triples and doubles at 78-84%, with backoff sets at 5-8 reps at lower intensity. Total volume decreases while average intensity increases.

**Phase 3 — Peaking (Weeks 9-12)**: Competition lifts use heavy singles and doubles at 85-92%. Backoff work is minimal (2-3 sets of 3 at 75-80%). Accessories are reduced to 2-3 sets.

**Phase 4 — Competition Prep & Taper (Weeks 13-16)**: Weeks 13-14 include opener-level singles at 90-95%. Week 15 has minimal volume at moderate intensity. Week 16 is a taper week: light singles at 75-80% to stay sharp without accumulating fatigue.

## Progressive Overload

The program uses **weekly linear periodization within phases** and **phase-to-phase block progression**:

- **Weeks 1-4**: Percentage increases 3% per week (67% → 70% → 73% → 75%) while reps decrease (7 → 6 → 5 → 4). Total volume stays roughly constant.
- **Weeks 5-8**: Top sets climb from 78% to 84%, backoff volume decreases. The shift from sets-across to top set + backoffs allows heavier absolute loads.
- **Weeks 9-12**: Intensity reaches 85-92% with 1-2 rep sets. Volume drops significantly to manage fatigue.
- **Weeks 13-16**: Final heavy singles, then controlled reduction in volume and intensity for supercompensation at the meet.

**Failure protocol**: This program does not have a built-in deload or failure reset. If a prescribed weight feels too heavy on a given day, reduce by 2-5% — the original program uses RPE for this purpose. If you consistently miss weights, your entered 1RM is likely too high — reduce it by 5-10%.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the program for exactly **16 weeks**, ideally timed so week 16 aligns with your competition or gym test day. It is not designed to be looped — the peaking structure means performance is optimized for the final week.

After completing the program and setting new PRs, transition to a general strength or hypertrophy program for 8-12 weeks to rebuild work capacity before peaking again. Good follow-up programs include the Calgary Barbell 8-Week program (shorter peaking cycle), or a general strength program like [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) or [GZCL: Jacked and Tan 2.0](/programs/gzcl-jacked-and-tan-2) for a hypertrophy-focused off-season.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, power rack with safety pins, flat bench
- Plates (enough to load to your working weights)
- Dumbbells (for single-arm rows)

**Substitutions for missing equipment**: If you don't have pins for [{Front Squat}] or pin squats, substitute paused squats. For [{Back Extension}], substitute [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] or [{Good Morning}]. For [{Bent Over One Arm Row}], substitute [{Seated Row}] or [{Lat Pulldown}].

## Rest Times

- **Competition lifts (heavy sets)**: 3-5 minutes between sets
- **Competition lifts (backoff sets)**: 2-3 minutes
- **Accessories**: 60-120 seconds between sets

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Enter your current 1RM for [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Deadlift}] in the app. The program calculates all working weights as percentages of your 1RM. If you don't know your 1RM, use a recent heavy set and an online 1RM calculator (e.g., if you did 225 lb for 5 reps, your estimated 1RM is approximately 253 lb).

**Common mistake**: Entering aspirational 1RMs rather than current, realistic ones. Use a weight you could hit on a normal training day, not your all-time best from 6 months ago.

For accessory exercises ([{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Back Extension}], [{Bent Over One Arm Row}]), start conservative — these should be moderate effort (roughly RPE 7-8) and prioritize form.

## Common Modifications

- **No pin squat access**: Replace with paused squat (2-3 second pause in the hole) at the same percentage
- **No Spoto press familiarity**: Replace with close-grip bench press or 2-board press
- **Adding arm work**: Add 2-3 sets of [{Bicep Curl}] and [{Triceps Pushdown}] at the end of upper body days if desired
- **Running without a meet**: Treat week 16 as a gym max-out week — test your 1RM on squat, bench, and deadlift across separate sessions
- **Time-constrained**: Drop one accessory movement per day and superset rows with pressing movements where possible

<!-- faq -->

### Is the Calgary Barbell 16-Week program good for beginners?

No. The program assumes you have established 1RMs on squat, bench press, and deadlift, and that you're comfortable with competition-style paused bench press and squat variations like front squats and pin squats. Beginners should build a strength base with a linear progression program first and run this once they have at least 6-12 months of training experience.

### How many days per week is the Calgary Barbell 16-Week program?

The program runs 4 days per week. Each session includes a primary competition lift, a secondary pressing or pulling movement, and 2-3 accessories. Sessions typically take 75-90 minutes.

### Can I run the Calgary Barbell 16-Week program without preparing for a meet?

Yes. Many lifters run it as a general peaking cycle to test gym maxes. Treat week 16 as a max-out week — test your squat, bench, and deadlift 1RMs across separate sessions that week.

### Why does the Calgary Barbell program have bench press 4 times per week?

High bench frequency is one of the program's defining features. Bench press responds well to frequent practice because the movement has a high skill component. By training it 4x/week with different variations (paused, touch-and-go, Spoto/close-grip, light technique), you accumulate volume without overloading any single pattern. Most users report bench as their most improved lift on this program.

### What results can I expect from the Calgary Barbell 16-Week program?

Results vary, but user reviews commonly report 15-80 lb squat increases, 15-25 lb bench increases, and 25-50 lb deadlift increases over the full 16 weeks. A 22-year-old male user went from a 315/225/405 total to 395/275/455. Results depend heavily on training history, bodyweight, and nutrition.

### How do I handle RPE prescriptions if I'm not familiar with RPE?

This implementation converts all RPE-based prescriptions to approximate percentages of 1RM, so you don't need RPE experience. The percentages are estimates — if a prescribed weight feels unusually hard or easy on a given day, adjust by 2-5% up or down. That self-adjustment is essentially what RPE does.

### Can I add extra accessories to the Calgary Barbell program?

Yes, but be conservative. The program already has substantial volume on the competition lifts. Adding 2-3 light isolation movements (curls, lateral raises, face pulls) at the end of sessions is fine. Avoid adding heavy compound movements that compete with recovery from the main lifts, especially in weeks 9-16 when intensity is highest.

### What should I do after finishing the Calgary Barbell 16-Week program?

Don't repeat it immediately. Take 4-8 weeks on a general strength or hypertrophy program to rebuild work capacity and address weak points identified during peaking. Then you can run it again with updated 1RMs, or try the Calgary Barbell 8-Week version for a shorter peaking cycle.
