## Origin & Philosophy

Created by Reddit user [/u/metallicadpa](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) and posted to r/Fitness in 2015. It quickly became the recommended PPL routine in the [r/Fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/reddit-archive/a-linear-progression-based-ppl-program-for-beginners/) and one of the most widely-used beginner programs on Reddit.

The program was designed to solve a common problem: beginners want to train more than 3 days per week and give attention to arms, shoulders, and chest, but most beginner programs are full-body 3x/week. Metallicadpa's solution was to take proven linear progression principles and apply them within a PPL structure, giving beginners a sane way to train 6 days per week while still progressing appropriately on the main lifts.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level:** Beginners (0-12 months), can extend into early intermediate
- **Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with barbell movements. You should know how to squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press with reasonable form.
- **Primary goal:** Strength and hypertrophy — heavy compounds build strength, higher-rep accessories drive muscle growth
- **Cut/bulk/maintenance:** Works for all. On a cut, you may need to reduce accessory volume (e.g., drop 1 set per isolation exercise) if recovery suffers. Prioritize keeping main lift volume intact.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Hits each muscle group twice per week, which is optimal frequency for hypertrophy
- Includes direct arm, shoulder, and rear delt work that full-body beginner programs typically skip
- AMRAP sets on main lifts give built-in autoregulation — you get real-time feedback on your progress
- Simple linear progression makes programming decisions automatic
- High training frequency builds exercise proficiency quickly

**Cons:**
- Requires 6 gym sessions per week — not practical if you can't commit to that schedule
- No direct ab work in the base program — you'll need to add it yourself
- Squat has only 3 working sets per session (2x5, 1x5+), which some lifters find insufficient for leg development
- The secondary press on each push day (3x8-12) can feel redundant alongside the heavy 5x5 work on the alternating day

## Program Structure

- **Split type:** Push/Pull/Legs (PPL)
- **Periodization style:** Linear progression on compounds, double progression on accessories
- **Schedule:** Fixed 6-day weekly cycle with 1 rest day. Either PPLRPPL or PPLPPLR — the rest day placement doesn't matter.
- **Alternating main lifts:** [{Deadlift}] and [{Bent Over Row}] alternate between the two pull days. [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] alternate between the two push days. Both legs days are identical.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Pull days** alternate the main barbell movement each session:
- [{Deadlift}] (1x5+) or [{Bent Over Row}] (4x5, 1x5+) — one heavy posterior chain pull per session, alternating to manage fatigue
- [{Lat Pulldown}] — vertical pull for lat width; can substitute [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Seated Row}] — horizontal pull for mid-back thickness
- [{Face Pull}] — high-rep rear delt and external rotation work, critical for shoulder health given the pressing volume
- [{Hammer Curl}] + [{Bicep Curl}] — direct arm work hitting both the brachialis and biceps

**Push days** alternate the main press each session:
- [{Bench Press}] (4x5, 1x5+) or [{Overhead Press}] (4x5, 1x5+) — heavy press as the main lift
- The other press as an accessory at 3x8-12 — maintains frequency on both movements
- [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] — upper chest emphasis and unilateral pressing
- [{Triceps Pushdown}] + [{Triceps Extension}] — direct tricep work from two angles (pushdown for lateral head, overhead extension for long head)
- [{Lateral Raise}] — 6 total sets for medial delt development, which pressing alone doesn't adequately train

**Legs days** are identical both sessions:
- [{Squat}] (2x5, 1x5+) — primary quad/glute movement
- [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] — hip hinge targeting hamstrings and glutes
- [{Leg Press}] — additional quad volume without spinal loading
- [{Seated Leg Curl}] — direct hamstring isolation
- [{Standing Calf Raise}] — direct calf work

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Main compounds** (4x5, 1x5+ or equivalent): The first 4 sets are straight working sets at 5 reps. The 5th set is AMRAP — do as many reps as you can with good form, but don't grind to absolute failure. Stop when bar speed slows significantly or form breaks down. The AMRAP set provides extra stimulus on good days and serves as a progress benchmark.

[{Deadlift}] is an exception: only 1x5+ (one AMRAP set). Deadlift is the most fatiguing lift, and 1 heavy AMRAP set plus the RDL work on leg days provides sufficient posterior chain stimulus.

[{Squat}] uses 2x5, 1x5+ (3 working sets). The lower set count is offset by squatting twice per week plus [{Leg Press}], [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}], and [{Seated Leg Curl}] for additional lower body volume.

**Accessories** (3-5 sets of 8-12 or 15-20): Higher rep ranges target hypertrophy. [{Face Pull}] and [{Lateral Raise}] use 15-20 reps because lighter isolation movements respond well to higher reps and this protects the shoulder joint.

## Progressive Overload

**Compounds (linear progression):**
- Add **5lb per session** to [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], and [{Squat}]
- Add **10lb per session** to [{Deadlift}]
- This applies every session you successfully complete all prescribed sets and reps

**Accessories (double progression):**
- Start at the bottom of the rep range (8 reps for most, 15 reps for face pulls and lateral raises)
- Each session, try to add reps while maintaining good form
- When you hit the top of the range (12 reps, or 20 for face pulls/lateral raises) for all sets, add 5lb and reset to the bottom
- [{Leg Press}] uses 10lb increments

**Deload protocol:**
- If you fail to complete the prescribed reps for **3 consecutive sessions** on a lift, deload by **10%**
- Work back up — your AMRAP sets on the way back up should beat your previous bests, confirming you've recovered and adapted

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the program as long as you continue making progress — typically **3-12 months** depending on training history. A beginner is defined as someone who can add weight session-to-session; once this stalls frequently despite deloads, you've exhausted linear progression.

Signs it's time to move on:
- Deloading frequently on multiple lifts (3+ deloads on the same lift)
- AMRAP sets barely hitting the minimum 5 reps consistently
- Recovery becoming unsustainable despite adequate sleep and nutrition

**Transition to:** An intermediate program with weekly or multi-week progression — 'GZCLP', '5/3/1 for Beginners', or 'GZCL: The Rippler'.

## Equipment Needed

- **Barbell and plates** — for all main compounds and RDL
- **Dumbbells** — for incline press, curls, lateral raises, tricep extensions
- **Cable machine** — for lat pulldown, seated row, face pulls, tricep pushdown
- **Leg press machine** and **leg curl machine**

**Home gym substitutions:**
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] or [{T Bar Row}]
- [{Face Pull}] → [{Reverse Fly}] plus band pull-aparts
- [{Triceps Pushdown}] → [{Skullcrusher}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Front Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]
- [{Seated Leg Curl}] → [{Romanian Deadlift}] (additional sets)

## Rest Times

- **Main lifts** ([{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Bent Over Row}]): **3-5 minutes** between sets
- **Accessories**: **1-3 minutes** between sets
- [{Lateral Raise}] can be supersetted with [{Triceps Pushdown}] and [{Triceps Extension}] to save time — the original program prescribes them as supersets

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**For main lifts:** Start with an empty barbell and add weight in sets of 5 reps. When bar speed noticeably slows, back off 5lb — that's your starting working weight. Don't ego lift on day one; starting too light is always better than starting too heavy.

**For accessories:** Pick a weight you can do for 12 reps with good form but that feels challenging. If you can easily do 15+, go heavier. If you struggle to hit 8, go lighter.

**Common mistake:** Starting too heavy. The linear progression adds up fast — 5lb per session on bench × 2 sessions/week = 10lb/week. Starting conservative gives you months of uninterrupted progress.

## Common Modifications

- **Can't train 6 days:** Run it as a 3-day program (Pull, Push, Legs). Progress will be slower with less frequency.
- **Want more ab work:** Add [{Hanging Leg Raise}], [{Ab Wheel}], or [{Cable Crunch}] to deadlift and squat days.
- **Pull-ups instead of lat pulldowns:** [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}] work as a direct swap. If you can't do 3x8, use assisted pull-ups or do negatives.
- **Want more rear delt work:** The 5x15-20 [{Face Pull}] already provides substantial rear delt volume. If you still want more, add [{Reverse Fly}] on pull days.
- **Supersets for time savings:** The original program supersets [{Triceps Pushdown}] with [{Lateral Raise}], then [{Triceps Extension}] with [{Lateral Raise}]. In this implementation they're listed separately — perform them back-to-back to save time.
