A 3-day full-body program that applies Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 methodology to beginners. Each session trains two main barbell lifts through the 5/3/1 rep scheme plus 5x5 First Set Last (FSL) supplemental sets, followed by push/pull/core assistance work for 50-100 reps per category.

## Origin & Philosophy

5/3/1 for Beginners is Jim Wendler's adaptation of his [5/3/1 system](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner) for novice lifters. Wendler — a former Westside Barbell trainee who squatted 1,000 lbs — created 5/3/1 around one principle: start light and progress slowly. The standard 5/3/1 trains one main lift per day across 4 days. The beginner version condenses this to 3 full-body sessions with two main lifts per day, giving beginners more weekly practice with the big barbell movements while keeping the program simple.

The Training Max (TM) concept is central to the system. You base all working weights on 90% of your actual 1RM, not your true max. This builds in a buffer so you're never grinding reps — every set should be fast, controlled, and with good form. Weight only goes up 5-10 lbs per 3-week cycle, which feels slow at first but compounds into serious strength over months.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Beginner to intermediate (3-18 months of gym experience). You should be comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}] form before starting.
- **Primary goal**: Strength, with some muscle building from the FSL volume and assistance work.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance. Can work on a cut, but drop assistance volume to 25-50 reps per category if recovery is an issue.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- [{Squat}] and [{Bench Press}] are trained twice per week (Days 1 and 3), accelerating technique development for the two lifts beginners struggle with most
- The Training Max system prevents you from ever loading too heavy — you always have reps in reserve, which builds confidence and reduces injury risk
- FSL 5x5 adds meaningful volume at a manageable intensity (65-75% TM), reinforcing technique with submaximal loads
- Only 3 days per week with sessions around 45-60 minutes — fits most schedules
- AMRAP sets provide auto-regulation: good days you get extra reps, bad days you hit the minimum

**Cons**

- [{Deadlift}] and [{Overhead Press}] are only trained once per week (Day 2), which limits practice frequency for those movements
- Weight increases are fixed (5/10 lbs per cycle regardless of AMRAP performance), so strong beginners may feel progression is too slow compared to programs like Starting Strength or [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp)
- Assistance work is intentionally vague ("50-100 reps of push/pull/core") — beginners who want more structure may feel lost on exercise selection
- No built-in deload week in the 3-week cycle — you need to self-manage recovery or add a TM test week every 6-9 weeks

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body
- **Periodization**: Weekly undulating periodization (5s week, 3s week, 5/3/1 week) with fixed progression per cycle
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — Mon/Wed/Fri or any 3 non-consecutive days
- **Typical week**: Day 1 (Squat + Bench) / Rest / Day 2 (Deadlift + OHP) / Rest / Day 3 (Bench + Squat) / Rest / Rest

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Day 1 and Day 3** pair [{Squat}] and [{Bench Press}] — the two lifts that benefit most from higher frequency. Beginners build squat and bench technique fastest when they practice 2x/week. Day 1 leads with squat; Day 3 leads with bench, so each lift gets one session as the "fresh" primary movement.

**Day 2** covers [{Deadlift}] and [{Overhead Press}]. These are trained once weekly because deadlifts are more fatiguing per rep than squats (limiting recovery), and overhead press benefits from the bench volume on Days 1 and 3.

**Assistance work** covers three categories to address what the main lifts miss:
- **Push** ([{Push Up}], [{Triceps Dip}]): extra chest/tricep volume beyond bench and OHP
- **Pull** ([{Chin Up}], [{Pull Up}], [{Inverted Row}]): horizontal and vertical pulling to balance all the pressing, plus bicep work
- **Single Leg/Core** ([{Hanging Leg Raise}], [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]): direct ab training and unilateral leg work for balance and stability

Assistance exercises can be freely swapped. Any push, pull, or single-leg/core movement works — the goal is total reps, not specific exercises.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Main lifts** follow the 5/3/1 wave across 3 weeks, with all percentages based on your Training Max (90% of 1RM):
- **Week 1 (5s)**: 1x5 @ 65%, 1x5 @ 75%, 1x5+ @ 85% TM
- **Week 2 (3s)**: 1x3 @ 70%, 1x3 @ 80%, 1x3+ @ 90% TM
- **Week 3 (5/3/1)**: 1x5 @ 75%, 1x3 @ 85%, 1x1+ @ 95% TM

The final set each week is AMRAP — do as many reps as possible while maintaining bar speed and form. Don't grind reps to failure; stop when the bar slows significantly or form breaks down.

**FSL (First Set Last)**: After the 3 working sets of each main lift, you go back to the weight from your first working set and perform 5 sets of 5 reps. The name "First Set Last" means you're repeating the first set's weight as your last sets. This gives you 5x5 at 65% TM in Week 1, 70% TM in Week 2, and 75% TM in Week 3. FSL serves as supplemental volume — it's light enough to practice technique with quality reps, but heavy enough to drive strength and muscle adaptation. This is the key difference from standard 5/3/1 templates that use heavier supplemental work like BBB (Boring But Big) or SSL (Second Set Last).

**Assistance work**: 50-100 total reps per category (push/pull/single leg or core). Set and rep scheme is flexible — 5x10, 3x15, 10x5, or anything that gets you to the target reps.

## Progressive Overload

After completing each 3-week cycle, add weight to your Training Max:
- **[{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}]**: +10 lbs
- **[{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}]**: +5 lbs

These increments are fixed — your AMRAP performance doesn't change the amount you add. The slow, steady progression is by design.

**When you stall**: If you can't hit the prescribed minimum reps (5/3/1) on your AMRAP sets for a full cycle, reduce your TM by 3 cycle increments (15 lbs for upper body, 30 lbs for lower body) and rebuild. Occasional bad sessions are normal — only adjust if an entire cycle is a struggle.

**TM Test Week (optional deload)**: Every 2-3 cycles (6-9 weeks), take a test week. Work up to your TM for 3-5 reps. If you get 3+ reps, your TM is appropriate. If not, recalculate your TM from that performance. This replaces the older "deload every 4th week" approach.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run 5/3/1 for Beginners for **6-12 months** or until you've completed 8-12 cycles. The program works as long as you can consistently add weight to your TM every 3 weeks.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You're no longer getting 3+ reps on AMRAP sets despite TM resets, you've been running it for 6+ months and want more variety, or your strength goals require more specialized programming.

**Transition to**: [5/3/1 Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) (adds hypertrophy volume), [5/3/1 Building the Monolith](/programs/monolith531) (brutally challenging intermediate program), or [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) (if you want a different progression model). Any standard 5/3/1 template from *5/3/1 Forever* is the natural next step.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, squat rack, bench, and weight plates for the main lifts. The assistance work as written uses bodyweight exercises, so a pull-up bar is the only additional equipment needed.

**If you don't have a pull-up bar**:
- [{Chin Up}] / [{Pull Up}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] or [{Inverted Row}] (using a barbell in the rack)
- [{Inverted Row}] → [{Bent Over Row}] with a barbell

**Other assistance swaps**:
- [{Triceps Dip}] → [{Bench Dip}] or [{Skullcrusher}]
- [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] → [{Lunge}] or [{Goblet Squat}]

## Rest Times

- **Main working sets** (5/3/1 sets): **2-3 minutes**. Up to 5 minutes for the AMRAP set if needed.
- **FSL 5x5 sets**: **90-120 seconds**. These should feel moderate, not maximal.
- **Assistance work**: **60-90 seconds**. Can be supersetted between categories to save time (e.g., push ups between chin up sets).

## How to Pick Starting Weights

1. For each main lift, work up to a weight you can do for 3-5 clean reps with good bar speed
2. Plug that weight and rep count into a 1RM calculator (e.g., weight x reps x 0.0333 + weight)
3. Set your Training Max at **90% of that estimated 1RM**
4. All working weights are calculated from your TM

**Common mistake**: Using your actual 1RM as the Training Max instead of 90% of it. The whole system breaks down if your TM is too high — you'll grind reps instead of building speed and volume.

## Common Modifications

- **Add conditioning**: Wendler recommends light running or conditioning on 2-3 off days. Keep it easy — it shouldn't interfere with lifting.
- **Swap assistance exercises freely**: The push/pull/single-leg categories are what matter, not the specific exercises. Rotate as desired.
- **Reduce assistance to 25-50 reps** if sessions run long or recovery is an issue (especially when cutting).
- **Add [{Face Pull}]** to the pull category for shoulder health — the program is pressing-heavy with bench 2x/week plus OHP.
- **Move to 4-day 5/3/1** (one lift per day) once you've run the beginner version for 6+ months and want to add more supplemental or assistance volume per session.

### Is 5/3/1 for Beginners good for beginners?

Yes, it's Jim Wendler's adaptation of his 5/3/1 system for novice lifters. You should have 3-18 months of gym experience and be comfortable with squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press form. It pairs two main lifts per session with bodyweight assistance work.

### How many days a week is 5/3/1 for Beginners?

It's a 3-day program trained on non-consecutive days, typically Monday/Wednesday/Friday. Day 1 pairs squat and bench, Day 2 pairs deadlift and overhead press, and Day 3 pairs bench and squat (reversed order from Day 1).

### How does progression work on 5/3/1 for Beginners?

After each 3-week cycle, add 10 lbs to your squat and deadlift Training Max and 5 lbs to your bench and overhead press Training Max. These fixed increments apply regardless of AMRAP performance. The slow progression is by design.

### What is FSL in 5/3/1 for Beginners?

FSL stands for First Set Last — after your 3 main working sets, you go back to the weight from your first working set and do 5 sets of 5 reps. This provides supplemental volume at a manageable intensity (65-75% of Training Max) for technique practice and strength building.

### How long should I run 5/3/1 for Beginners?

Run it for 6-12 months or 8-12 cycles. The program works as long as you can add weight to your Training Max every 3 weeks. Move on when AMRAP sets barely hit minimum reps despite TM resets, or when you want more variety.

### What is the Training Max in 5/3/1?

The Training Max (TM) is 90% of your true 1RM. All working percentages are based on this number, not your actual max. This builds in a buffer so you're never grinding reps — every set should be fast and controlled with good form.
