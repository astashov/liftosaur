A 21-week hypertrophy-focused program by Greg Nuckols (Stronger by Science) that uses block periodization with wave loading and AMRAP-based autoregulation. Training intensity gradually climbs from ~65-70% to ~82.5% of 1RM across three 7-week blocks, while rep ranges decrease from sets of 10-12 down to sets of 5-7. The last set of every exercise is an AMRAP that automatically adjusts your training max for the following week.

## Origin & Philosophy

The SBS (Stronger by Science) Hypertrophy program was created by [Greg Nuckols](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/program-bundle/) as part of the Stronger by Science Program Bundle (formerly known as Average to Savage 2.0). The program bundle includes six templates — three strength-focused and three hypertrophy-focused — all built on the same autoregulation framework.

The core philosophy is that hypertrophy requires moderately heavy loads performed close to failure with adequate volume, and that the best way to manage load progression is through performance-based autoregulation rather than fixed percentages. Every exercise ends with an AMRAP set whose result drives training max adjustments, making the program self-correcting: good days result in bigger jumps, bad days trigger automatic deloads.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (1-3 years of consistent barbell training). Beginners may struggle with the volume and autoregulation demands.
- **Prerequisites**: Known or estimated 1RMs for [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}]. Enough conditioning to handle sets of 10-12 on compound lifts without being limited by cardiovascular fitness.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy with meaningful strength gains as a byproduct
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. The high-rep work in Block 1 is demanding and benefits from adequate caloric intake.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- AMRAP-based autoregulation adjusts your training max every week — if you underestimate your 1RM, the program self-corrects within a few weeks
- High-rep sets of 10-12 in Block 1 build significant muscle mass, particularly in the quads and upper back
- The wave-loading structure provides built-in variation so training doesn't feel repetitive week to week
- Exercise selection is highly customizable — swap any auxiliary lift for a variation that targets your weak points
- Intensity never exceeds ~82.5% of 1RM, keeping joint stress manageable over the full 21 weeks

**Cons**

- High-rep compound sets (especially [{Squat}] sets of 10+) can be limited by cardiovascular fitness rather than muscular strength in Block 1
- No direct arm or lateral delt work in the default template — you'll need to add your own isolation accessories
- The program requires honest effort on AMRAP sets for the autoregulation to work — sandbagging ruins the feedback loop
- Sessions run 60-90 minutes due to 4 exercises per day with 4 sets each, plus warmups
- The 21-week commitment is long — lifters who prefer variety may lose motivation by Block 3

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Upper/lower hybrid — each day pairs a core lift with auxiliary movements for related muscle groups
- **Periodization**: Block periodization with weekly undulating wave loading. Three 7-week blocks, each containing two 3-week waves of decreasing reps and increasing intensity, plus a deload week. Daily undulation between core lifts (higher intensity) and auxiliary lifts (lower intensity, higher reps).
- **Schedule**: Fixed 4-day weekly split. Day 1 focuses on [{Squat}] and [{Bench Press}] auxiliaries, Day 2 on [{Bench Press}] and [{Squat}] auxiliaries, Day 3 on [{Deadlift}] and [{Overhead Press}] auxiliaries, Day 4 on [{Overhead Press}] and [{Deadlift}] auxiliaries.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Core lifts** — [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}] — are each trained once per week at higher intensity. These provide the primary progressive overload stimulus.

**Auxiliary lifts** provide additional volume for each movement pattern at lower intensity (+2 reps, -5% of 1RM vs. core lifts). [{Front Squat}] and [{Leg Press}] support squat development. [{Incline Bench Press}] and [{Bench Press Close Grip}] add pressing volume from different angles. [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] builds the posterior chain. [{Seated Overhead Press}] adds shoulder pressing volume.

Auxiliary lifts can be freely swapped. Common substitutions: [{Hack Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] for [{Leg Press}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] for [{Incline Bench Press}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] for [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}].

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Core lifts** use 3 working sets + 1 AMRAP set. Reps per working set decrease across blocks:
- Block 1 (Weeks 1-6): 10→9→8 / 9→8→7 reps at 70→72.5→75% / 72.5→75→77.5% of 1RM
- Block 2 (Weeks 8-13): 8→7→6 / 7→6→5 reps at 75→77.5→80% / 77.5→80→82.5%
- Block 3 (Weeks 15-20): 7→6→5 / 6→5→5 reps at 77.5→80→82.5% / 80→82.5→82.5%

**Auxiliary lifts** follow the same wave pattern but at 5% lower intensity and 2 more reps per set (e.g., when core is 3x10 at 70%, auxiliary is 3x12 at 65%).

**AMRAP set** rep targets are always working reps + 2. For example, if working sets are 3x10, the AMRAP target is 12+.

All working sets should be moderately challenging (roughly RPE 7-8). The AMRAP set should be taken to or very near failure.

**Deload weeks** (7, 14, 21) use reduced intensity (60% core, 55% auxiliary) for 3x5 with no AMRAP, allowing recovery before the next block.

## Progressive Overload

The program uses AMRAP-based autoregulation to adjust your estimated 1RM after every workout:
- Beat the AMRAP target by 5+ reps: 1RM increases by 3%
- Beat by 4 reps: +2%
- Beat by 3 reps: +1.5%
- Beat by 2 reps: +1%
- Beat by 1 rep: +0.5%
- Hit the target exactly: no change
- Miss by 1 rep: 1RM decreases by 2%
- Miss by 2+ reps: 1RM decreases by 5%

This system is self-correcting. If you set your initial 1RM too high, you'll miss AMRAP targets and the weights will auto-adjust down. If too low, you'll crush AMRAP targets and weights will quickly ramp up.

There is no separate stalling or deload protocol — the AMRAP autoregulation handles both by design. The programmed deload weeks (7, 14, 21) manage accumulated fatigue.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the full 21 weeks as written. The program is designed as a complete macrocycle — cutting it short misses the progression from high-volume Block 1 through the intensity peak of Block 3.

After completing the 21 weeks, you can:
- Run it again with updated 1RMs (many lifters run 2-3 consecutive cycles)
- Transition to the SBS Strength template if you want to peak for 1RM testing
- Switch to a peaking program like [Bullmastiff](/programs/bullmastiff) if you want to capitalize on the muscle built

Signs it's time to move on: consistent failure to hit AMRAP targets across multiple exercises for 2+ weeks despite adequate sleep and nutrition.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates (primary)
- Squat rack / power rack
- Flat bench, incline bench
- Leg press machine (substitute [{Hack Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] if unavailable)
- Cable machine for accessories (optional)

## Rest Times

- Core lifts: 3-5 minutes between sets (high-rep sets need longer rest — take what you need)
- Auxiliary lifts: 2-3 minutes between sets
- Greg Nuckols recommends letting rest times run long if you have the time, especially for high-rep squat and deadlift sets where cardiovascular recovery is the bottleneck

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Enter your known or estimated 1RM for each exercise. The program calculates all working weights as percentages of that 1RM. If you don't know your 1RM:
- Use an online 1RM calculator based on a recent heavy set (e.g., if you did 225 for 5, your estimated 1RM is ~253)
- Start conservative — set your 1RM 5-10% lower than your true max. The AMRAP autoregulation will correct upward within 2-3 weeks.
- For auxiliary lifts, estimate separately since your 1RM on [{Front Squat}] will differ from [{Squat}]

The most common mistake is entering too-aggressive 1RMs. If your first week's sets of 10 feel like RPE 9-10, drop your training max by 5-10%.

## Common Modifications

- **Cardio-limited squats**: If high-rep [{Squat}] sets are limited by breathing rather than leg strength, consider using the Strength RTF rep scheme for squats while keeping hypertrophy reps for everything else
- **More arm work**: Add 2-3 sets each of [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] and [{Triceps Pushdown}] at the end of upper body days
- **More lateral delt work**: Add 3 sets of [{Lateral Raise}] to pressing days
- **3-day version**: Drop Day 4, distribute [{Overhead Press}] to Day 1 or 2
- **5-day version**: Split the 4-day template so each day has fewer exercises with more focus
- **Increasing volume across blocks**: Start with 3 working sets + 1 AMRAP in Block 1, add 1 extra working set per block (4+1 in Block 2, 5+1 in Block 3)

### Is the SBS Hypertrophy program good for beginners?

Not ideally. Beginners typically progress faster on simpler linear progression programs. The SBS Hypertrophy template is best for intermediate lifters (1+ years of training) who have stalled on beginner programs and need more volume and periodization to continue growing.

### How many days per week does the SBS Hypertrophy program require?

The default template runs 4 days per week, but the official spreadsheet offers options for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days per week. This Liftosaur implementation uses the standard 4-day setup. Each session takes roughly 60-90 minutes.

### Can I run the SBS Hypertrophy program on a cut?

Yes, but reduce volume if recovery suffers. Some lifters drop one working set per exercise during a cut (2 working sets + 1 AMRAP instead of 3+1). The autoregulation system will also naturally reduce your training max if performance drops during a deficit.

### What's the difference between SBS Hypertrophy and SBS Strength?

Both use the same autoregulation framework, but the Hypertrophy template uses higher reps (5-12) at lower intensities (65-82.5% of 1RM), while the Strength template uses lower reps (1-6) at higher intensities (70-100%). The Hypertrophy template caps at 82.5% and never programs singles or doubles. Strength is better for peaking, Hypertrophy is better for building muscle.

### How does the AMRAP autoregulation work in SBS Hypertrophy?

The last set of every exercise is taken to or near failure. Each week has a rep target for that AMRAP set (usually 2 reps above the working set reps). If you beat the target, your estimated 1RM increases by 0.5% per extra rep. If you miss it, your 1RM decreases by 2-5%. This adjusts all future working weights automatically.

### Should I use overwarm singles with the SBS Hypertrophy template?

Overwarm singles (a heavy single at RPE 8 before working sets) are optional. They provide an additional autoregulation data point and help maintain familiarity with heavier weights. Most lifters skip them for the hypertrophy template since the rep ranges are high enough that heavy singles aren't necessary for the program's goals.

### What accessories should I add to the SBS Hypertrophy program?

The default template covers the main movement patterns but lacks direct arm, lateral delt, and rear delt work. Common additions: 2-3 sets each of Bicep Curls, Triceps Pushdowns, Lateral Raises, and Face Pulls at the end of sessions. Use double progression (increase reps within a range, then add weight) for accessories rather than percentage-based loading.

### Can I swap out exercises in the SBS Hypertrophy program?

Yes — exercise customization is a core feature of SBS programs. Core lifts can be swapped for similar compounds (e.g., Trap Bar Deadlift instead of Deadlift). Auxiliary lifts should be close variations of the core lift they support (e.g., Front Squat as a Squat auxiliary, Close Grip Bench as a Bench auxiliary). Accessories are entirely up to you.
