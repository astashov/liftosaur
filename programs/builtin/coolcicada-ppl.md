A 6-day Push/Pull/Legs split that pairs heavy compound work (3-4 sets of 5 reps) with moderate-volume accessories (3-4 sets of 10-12 reps). Originally posted on the Bodybuilding.com forums in 2012 by user Coolcicada, it remains one of the most widely-used PPL templates for intermediate lifters.

## Origin & Philosophy

Created by Bodybuilding.com forum user [Coolcicada](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833) in 2012. The original thread has since been archived as part of Bodybuilding.com's forum changes, but the routine has been preserved across dozens of fitness sites and spreadsheets.

The philosophy is straightforward: start each session with heavy compound movements in the 5-rep range to build strength, then follow up with 2-3 accessory exercises per muscle group in the 8-12 rep range for hypertrophy. This powerbuilding approach gives intermediate lifters a way to keep driving strength gains on the main lifts while accumulating enough volume for muscle growth.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level:** Intermediate lifters (roughly 1+ years of consistent training). The original post was intended for lifters past the beginner stage who can no longer add weight every session on a full-body program.
- **Prerequisites:** Solid form on [{Bench Press}], [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Bent Over Row}]. You should be roughly at or approaching a 1x bodyweight bench, 1.5x bodyweight squat, and 2x bodyweight deadlift.
- **Primary goal:** Strength and hypertrophy — compounds build strength, accessories drive muscle growth.
- **Cut/bulk/maintenance:** Best suited for bulking or maintenance. On a cut, you may need to reduce accessory sets (drop to 2 sets per isolation) or extend rest times.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Each muscle group gets hit twice per week at meaningful volume — 6-9 working sets per muscle group per session
- Three heavy barbell compounds per push day ([{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Incline Bench Press}]) build pressing strength fast
- Face pulls and lateral raises included for shoulder health and aesthetics — areas many programs neglect
- Simple template that's easy to customize by swapping accessories you don't like
- Sessions have a clear structure: heavy compounds first, moderate accessories second

**Cons:**
- No formal deload protocol or failure strategy — the original post gives minimal guidance on what to do when you stall
- Deadlifts were optional in the original program, meaning some lifters skip the most productive posterior chain exercise
- No direct ab or core work — you'll need to add your own
- Three barbell compounds at 3x5 on push day can be fatiguing, especially [{Incline Bench Press}] after [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}]
- Progression guidance is vague: "5lbs/week in compounds" doesn't specify when to increase or what to do on failure

## Program Structure

- **Split type:** Push/Pull/Legs (PPL)
- **Periodization style:** Linear progression on compounds, double progression on accessories
- **Schedule:** 6 days per week. Run Push, Pull, Legs twice with one rest day. Common patterns: PPL-rest-PPL or PPLPPL-rest.
- **All sessions are identical:** Unlike the Metallicadpa PPL which alternates main lifts, Coolcicada's PPL uses the same exercises on both push days, both pull days, and both legs days.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Push Day** targets chest, shoulders, and triceps with 7 exercises:
- [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Incline Bench Press}] — three barbell compounds cover flat pressing, vertical pressing, and upper chest. Running all three at 3x5 gives 9 heavy working sets across the pressing muscles.
- [{Lateral Raise}] — direct medial delt isolation that pressing movements don't adequately train.
- [{Triceps Pushdown}] + [{Triceps Extension}] — two tricep exercises from different angles (pushdown for lateral head, overhead extension for long head).
- [{Shrug}] — trap isolation. Originally placed on push day in the program, though many lifters move it to pull day since shrugging is mechanically a pull.

**Pull Day** targets back and biceps with 7 exercises:
- [{Deadlift}] (1x5) — heavy posterior chain compound. Optional in the original post but strongly recommended by the community and included in the revised version.
- [{Bent Over Row}] — primary horizontal pull for mid-back thickness.
- [{Lat Pulldown}] + [{Seated Row}] — machine/cable work for back volume from vertical and horizontal pulling angles.
- [{Face Pull}] — rear delt and external rotation work for shoulder health, especially important with the high pressing volume.
- [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] + [{Hammer Curl}] — direct bicep work hitting both the short/long head (barbell curl) and brachialis (hammer curl).

**Legs Day** targets quads, hamstrings, and calves with 5 exercises:
- [{Squat}] — primary quad/glute compound at higher volume (4x5-6) than the other compounds.
- [{Leg Press}] — additional quad work without spinal loading.
- [{Leg Extension}] + [{Seated Leg Curl}] — direct quad and hamstring isolation.
- [{Standing Calf Raise}] — 5 sets of calf work, which responds well to higher volume.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Compounds** (3x5 or 4x5): Straight working sets of 5 reps at moderate to heavy weight. [{Squat}] gets an extra set (4x5) reflecting its importance as the primary lower body lift. [{Deadlift}] is kept to 1x5 to manage fatigue given it's the most systemically taxing lift, and the pull day already includes 3 sets of barbell rows.

**Mid-range accessories** ([{Lat Pulldown}], [{Seated Row}], [{Leg Press}]): 3 sets of 8-10 reps. Moderate weight with a focus on controlled reps and muscle engagement.

**Isolation exercises** ([{Lateral Raise}], [{Triceps Pushdown}], [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}], etc.): 3-4 sets of 10-12 reps. Higher rep ranges suit isolation movements and protect joints from heavy loading.

**Calves** ([{Standing Calf Raise}]): 5 sets of 10-12. Calves are notoriously stubborn and respond to higher volume.

## Progressive Overload

**Compounds (linear progression):**
- Add **5lb per successful session** to [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Incline Bench Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], and [{Squat}]
- Add **10lb per successful session** to [{Deadlift}]
- Coolcicada's original guidance was "5lbs/week in compounds," which with 2 sessions per week per lift means roughly 2.5lb per session. This implementation uses 5lb per session since that's the smallest practical barbell increment, and deloads on failure.

**Accessories (double progression):**
- Start at the bottom of the rep range (8 reps for mid-range accessories, 10 reps for isolation exercises)
- Each session, aim to add reps while keeping form strict
- When you hit the top of the range (10 reps for mid-range, 12 for isolations) for all sets, add 5lb and drop back to the bottom of the rep range
- Coolcicada's guidance: "For isolations, once I am able to do 3 sets of 10 at a weight, I move up"

**Deload protocol:**
- If you fail to complete prescribed reps for 3 consecutive sessions on a compound lift, deload by 10%
- This wasn't in the original program but is standard practice for linear progression programs at this level

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run for **12-16 weeks** minimum. The original post recommends running the program as written for at least 12 weeks before making changes. You can run it longer if you're still progressing.

Signs it's time to move on:
- Stalling repeatedly on compounds despite deloads
- Recovery becoming unsustainable even with good sleep and nutrition
- You want more structured periodization rather than simple linear progression

**Transition to:** A program with weekly or block periodization — [GZCL: The Rippler](/programs/gzcl-the-rippler) for a structured 12-week mesocycle, [5/3/1 Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) for submaximal training with volume work, or [PHUL](/programs/phul) for an upper/lower split with similar powerbuilding philosophy.

## Equipment Needed

- **Barbell and plates** — for bench press, overhead press, incline bench, squat, deadlift, bent over row, barbell curls, shrugs
- **Dumbbells** — for lateral raises, hammer curls, and overhead tricep extensions
- **Cable machine** — for lat pulldowns, seated rows, face pulls, and tricep pushdowns
- **Leg press machine**, **leg extension machine**, and **leg curl machine**
- **Calf raise machine**

**Substitutions for limited equipment:**
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] or [{T Bar Row}]
- [{Face Pull}] → [{Reverse Fly}] with dumbbells
- [{Triceps Pushdown}] → [{Skullcrusher}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Front Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]
- [{Standing Calf Raise}] → Bodyweight calf raises on a step for higher reps

## Rest Times

- **Compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Incline Bench Press}]): **3-5 minutes** between sets to allow full recovery for heavy work
- **Accessories**: **1-2 minutes** between sets

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**For compounds:** If you've been training, use a weight you can comfortably hit for 5 clean reps with 1-2 reps left in the tank. If unsure, start conservatively — you'll be adding 5lb per session, so starting light gives you more runway.

**For accessories:** Pick a weight where you can do the bottom of the rep range (8 or 10 reps) with good form, but the last 2 reps feel challenging. If you can easily hit the top of the range (12 reps) on your first session, the weight is too light.

**Common mistake:** Starting too heavy on compounds. With 2 sessions per lift per week and 5lb jumps, you're adding 10lb/week to each lift. Starting 10-20lb lighter than your current working weight gives you weeks of smooth progression.

## Common Modifications

- **Shrugs on pull day:** Many lifters move [{Shrug}] from push to pull day since it's mechanically a pulling movement. This also shortens the already-long push day.
- **Alternating deadlifts:** If deadlifting every pull day is too fatiguing, alternate deadlift and non-deadlift pull days (similar to the Metallicadpa PPL approach).
- **Adding ab work:** The program has no direct core work. Add [{Hanging Leg Raise}], [{Ab Wheel}], or [{Cable Crunch}] at the end of pull or legs days.
- **Push day exercise order:** Some lifters rotate which compound goes first (bench → OHP → incline one session, OHP → bench → incline the next) to prevent one lift from always being fatigued.
- **Replacing incline barbell with dumbbell:** [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] can replace the barbell version for better range of motion and unilateral work, especially if your shoulders are fatigued after two heavy barbell presses.

### Is Coolcicada PPL good for beginners?

The program was designed for intermediate lifters (1+ years of training), but beginners can run it if they have solid form on the main barbell lifts. The lack of explicit progression rules and the high compound volume per session make it less beginner-friendly than programs like the Metallicadpa PPL, which spells out every detail of the progression scheme.

### How many days a week is Coolcicada PPL?

It's a 6-day program. You run Push, Pull, Legs twice per week with one rest day. Common schedules are PPL-rest-PPL or PPLPPL-rest. Running it 3 days per week (one of each) is possible but will reduce your training frequency and slow progress.

### Does Coolcicada PPL include deadlifts?

Deadlifts were optional in the original program but have been included in most revised versions. Unless you have a specific reason not to, you should deadlift. If doing deadlifts every pull day is too taxing, alternate between deadlift and non-deadlift pull sessions.

### What's the difference between Coolcicada PPL and the Reddit PPL?

The Reddit PPL (Metallicadpa) alternates main lifts between sessions (bench/OHP on push, deadlift/row on pull) and uses AMRAP sets for autoregulation. Coolcicada PPL keeps all sessions identical and uses straight sets. The Reddit PPL also provides more detailed progression instructions. Both programs hit similar volume and use the same PPL structure.

### How long should I run the Coolcicada PPL?

The original post recommends running it as written for at least 12 weeks before making modifications. You can continue beyond that as long as you're progressing. If you stall repeatedly on multiple lifts despite deloads, transition to a program with weekly or block periodization.

### Should I move shrugs to pull day on Coolcicada PPL?

Many lifters do, since a shrug is mechanically a pulling movement. The original program placed shrugs on push day, but moving them to pull day is one of the most common modifications. It also helps balance the session lengths since push day has 7 exercises.

### Can I do Coolcicada PPL on a cut?

You can, but you may need to reduce accessory volume. Drop isolation exercises to 2 sets instead of 3, or remove one accessory per day. Keep compound lifts at full volume since maintaining strength is the priority during a cut. Rest times may need to increase as well.

### What weight should I start with on Coolcicada PPL?

For compounds, use a weight you can do for 5 solid reps with 1-2 reps in reserve. For accessories, pick a weight at the bottom of the rep range (8 or 10 reps) that feels challenging on the last 2 reps. Starting too heavy is the most common mistake — the linear progression adds up fast.
