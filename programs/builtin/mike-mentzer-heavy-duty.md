Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty is a minimalist Push/Pull/Legs program built on High Intensity Training (HIT) principles. Each exercise is performed for just 1 working set taken to absolute muscular failure, with signature pre-exhaustion supersets pairing isolation exercises with compound movements. This is the 1993 "Ideal Routine" — the most widely practiced version and the one Mentzer prescribed to his personal training clients.

### Origin & Philosophy

Mike Mentzer (1951–2001) was an IFBB professional bodybuilder who won the 1978 Mr. Universe with a perfect score. Building on Arthur Jones' High Intensity Training (HIT) methodology, Mentzer developed Heavy Duty throughout the late 1970s and 1990s. The core principle: if you train with true maximal intensity (to complete muscular failure), you need very little volume to stimulate growth. Anything beyond the minimum effective dose doesn't help — it actively hinders recovery.

The program's signature technique is **pre-exhaustion supersets**: perform an isolation exercise to fatigue the target muscle, then immediately (no rest) perform a compound exercise for the same muscle group. This ensures the target muscle — not a weaker synergist — is the limiting factor in the compound movement.

Mentzer published several versions of Heavy Duty over his career. This implementation is the 1993 "Ideal Routine" from the second edition of [*Heavy Duty*](https://mikementzer.org/heavy-duty-the-ideal-routine/) — the most widely practiced version and the one he prescribed to most of his personal training clients. For context, Mentzer himself used a different version (the "Evolved OG" — a 2-way A/B split done 3x/week alternating) for his competition prep, and later developed even more minimalist versions including the infamous "Consolidated Routine" (just 3 exercises per workout, 2x/week).

### Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (1+ years of consistent training)
- **Prerequisites**: Must understand how to train to true muscular failure with good form. Beginners who haven't developed proper motor patterns risk injury training at this intensity.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy with strength gains
- **Suitability**: Works well on both a cut and bulk. The low volume is especially appropriate during a caloric deficit when recovery capacity is reduced.

### Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Pre-exhaust supersets ensure target muscles reach true failure even without a training partner
- Extreme time efficiency — sessions are under 45 minutes with only 5-6 working sets per day
- Low volume suits natural lifters who can't recover from high-volume programs
- Simple double progression scheme (add reps within a range, then add weight)
- Works especially well during a cut when recovery is limited

**Cons**

- Only 1 working set per exercise leaves zero margin — every rep must be maximally intense, which is mentally demanding
- Low weekly volume (3-6 sets per muscle group) may not provide sufficient stimulus for lifters who respond better to moderate volume (10-20 sets/week)
- Pre-exhaust supersets require two pieces of adjacent equipment or a home gym to avoid losing the superset effect while someone else takes your station
- No direct forearm work, and minimal lower back volume (just 1 set of [{Deadlift}])
- Controversial training philosophy — most modern research supports moderate volume over HIT-style single sets for maximizing hypertrophy

### Program Structure

- **Split type**: Push / Pull / Legs
- **Periodization**: Auto-regulated via double progression (increase reps to failure, add weight when you hit the top of the rep range)
- **Schedule**: Fixed 3-day weekly schedule (e.g., Monday / Wednesday / Friday)
- **Supersets**: Two exercises paired back-to-back (isolation → compound) with no rest between them

### Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Push Day**: [{Chest Fly}] pre-exhausts the pectorals before [{Incline Bench Press}] — this ensures the chest fails before the triceps on the press. Incline rather than flat press emphasizes the clavicular head, which Mentzer considered undertrained by flat pressing alone. [{Lateral Raise}] isolates the medial deltoid, and [{Reverse Fly}] targets the rear deltoid — both done as straight sets since shoulders are already partially fatigued from pressing. [{Skullcrusher}] pre-exhausts the triceps before [{Triceps Dip}], ensuring triceps failure rather than front delt or chest fatigue limiting the movement.

**Pull Day**: [{Pullover}] pre-exhausts the lats (Mentzer originally used the Nautilus Pullover machine; the dumbbell version is the best widely-available substitute). [{Lat Pulldown}] follows immediately to finish the lats when they're already fatigued — Mentzer specified a close underhand grip. [{Bent Over Row}] adds mid-back thickness. [{Shrug, Barbell}] hits the upper traps. [{Deadlift}] is included for lower back and posterior chain development — Mentzer listed "hyperextensions or deadlifts" and recommended low volume to avoid CNS overtaxing. [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] is the only direct arm work; Mentzer argued biceps get substantial indirect work from all pulling movements.

**Leg Day**: [{Leg Extension}] pre-exhausts the quadriceps before [{Leg Press}] — same pre-exhaust principle as the upper body supersets. Mentzer recommended alternating [{Leg Press}] and [{Squat}] workout to workout (this implementation uses Leg Press; swap in Squat every other session if desired). [{Lying Leg Curl}] isolates the hamstrings. [{Standing Calf Raise}] targets the gastrocnemius with higher reps (12-20) since calves are slow-twitch dominant. [{Crunch}] provides direct abdominal work.

**Substitutions**: [{Pullover}] can be swapped for a cable or machine pullover if available. [{Lat Pulldown}] should be done with a close underhand grip per Mentzer's specification — standard overhand grip is acceptable but changes the emphasis. [{Back Extension}] can replace [{Deadlift}] if lower back fatigue is a concern on pull day.

### Set & Rep Scheme

Every exercise is performed for **1 working set to absolute muscular failure**:

- **Upper body exercises**: 6-10 rep range. Push until you physically cannot complete another rep with proper form.
- **Lower body compound exercises**: 8-15 rep range. Higher reps compensate for the difficulty of reaching true failure on leg exercises.
- **Calves**: 12-20 rep range. Slow-twitch dominant muscles respond better to higher reps and longer time under tension.

Mentzer prescribed a controlled rep tempo: 4 seconds concentric (lifting), a brief pause at peak contraction, and 4 seconds eccentric (lowering). No momentum or bouncing.

Pre-exhaust supersets are performed with **zero rest** between the isolation and compound exercise. Move immediately from one to the other — any delay lets the target muscle recover, defeating the pre-exhaust effect.

### Progressive Overload

**Double progression** within each rep range:

1. Pick a weight that lets you reach the bottom of the rep range (6 reps upper body, 8 reps lower body) with maximum effort to failure.
2. Each session, try to get more reps with the same weight. Train to failure every time.
3. When you hit the top of the range (10 reps upper body, 15 reps lower body), increase the weight by 5lb (10lb for [{Leg Press}]) and drop back to the bottom of the range.
4. Repeat.

**When you stall**: Mentzer's prescription was to increase rest days between workouts rather than decrease weight. If you can't add reps or weight for 2-3 consecutive sessions, add an extra rest day between workouts (e.g., move from Mon/Wed/Fri to training every 3-4 days). If that doesn't work, switch to the Consolidated Routine (3 exercises per workout, 2x/week) for a period.

### How Long to Run It / What Next

Run Heavy Duty for **8-12 weeks** before reassessing. Signs it's time to change:

- Stalling frequently despite adding rest days
- Joints feeling beat up from constant failure training (especially elbows and shoulders)
- Mental fatigue from the intensity demands

Good transitions: [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) for submaximal percentage-based training with higher volume, or [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) for structured linear progression with tiered volume.

### Equipment Needed

As written, the program requires:

- Barbell and plates
- Dumbbells
- Lat pulldown machine (substitute: [{Chin Up}] or pull-ups)
- Leg extension machine (substitute: sissy squats or wall sits to pre-exhaust)
- Leg press machine (substitute: [{Squat}])
- Leg curl machine (substitute: Nordic hamstring curls or [{Romanian Deadlift}])
- Standing calf raise machine or dumbbells (substitute: single-leg calf raises on a step)

For a home gym with just a barbell, dumbbells, and a pull-up bar: replace [{Lat Pulldown}] with [{Chin Up}], [{Leg Extension}] with sissy squats, [{Leg Press}] with [{Squat}], [{Lying Leg Curl}] with [{Romanian Deadlift}], and [{Standing Calf Raise}] with single-leg dumbbell calf raises on a step.

### Rest Times

- **Between superset exercises**: Zero — move immediately from the isolation to the compound exercise
- **Between exercises/supersets**: 1-2 minutes, or until you feel recovered enough to give maximum effort on the next exercise
- **Between workouts**: At least 48 hours. Start with Mon/Wed/Fri. If recovery becomes an issue, extend to every 3-4 days.

### How to Pick Starting Weights

1. For each exercise, estimate the heaviest weight you can do for 6 strict reps (upper body) or 8 reps (lower body) with perfect form to failure.
2. For pre-exhaust supersets: the compound exercise weight will be significantly lower than usual because your muscles are pre-fatigued. Expect to use 20-30% less than you'd normally handle on the compound in isolation.
3. If you're unsure, start conservatively — better to add reps quickly the first week than to fail below the minimum rep range.
4. To estimate from a known 1RM: use approximately 75-80% for 6-rep exercises and 65-70% for 8-rep exercises.

### Common Modifications

- **Alternating Leg Press and Squat**: Mentzer recommended swapping the compound exercise in the leg superset each session — [{Leg Extension}] → [{Leg Press}] one workout, [{Leg Extension}] → [{Squat}] the next.
- **Adding extra rest days**: The most common modification. Many lifters need 3-4 days between workouts rather than 2. Mentzer himself eventually advocated for even longer rest periods (5-7 days).
- **The Consolidated Routine**: Mentzer's ultra-minimalist fallback — 2 workouts of just 3 exercises each, done once every 7-10 days. Workout A: [{Squat}], [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Triceps Dip}]. Workout B: [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Standing Calf Raise}].
- **Adding forced reps**: After reaching positive failure, a training partner provides minimal assistance for 1-2 additional reps. Use sparingly — only when progress stalls.
- **Swapping Deadlift for Back Extension**: If [{Deadlift}] is too taxing alongside the rest of pull day, [{Back Extension}] isolates the lower back with less CNS fatigue.

### Is Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty good for beginners?

Heavy Duty is not ideal for beginners. The program relies on training to absolute muscular failure with perfect form, which requires significant lifting experience to execute safely. Beginners benefit more from learning movement patterns with moderate intensity and higher volume. Train for at least 6-12 months with a beginner program first.

### How many sets per exercise does Heavy Duty prescribe?

Just 1 working set per exercise, taken to complete muscular failure. This is the defining feature of the program. Mentzer argued that if a set is truly taken to failure with maximum intensity, a second set is both unnecessary and counterproductive to recovery.

### How often should I train on Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty?

Start with 3 days per week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday). If you're recovering well and making progress, stay there. If progress stalls, add an extra rest day between sessions. Some advanced trainees on Heavy Duty train as infrequently as once every 4-5 days per workout.

### What is a pre-exhaust superset?

A pre-exhaust superset pairs an isolation exercise with a compound exercise for the same muscle group, done back-to-back with no rest. For example, Dumbbell Chest Fly immediately followed by Incline Bench Press. The isolation exercise fatigues the target muscle first so it becomes the limiting factor in the compound movement.

### Can you build muscle with just 1 set per exercise?

Mentzer and many Heavy Duty practitioners report significant muscle growth from single-set training. The key is that the set must be taken to true muscular failure — not just discomfort, but the point where you physically cannot complete another rep. Most modern research suggests moderate volume (10-20 sets per week) may produce slightly more hypertrophy, but low-volume HIT training can still produce meaningful results especially for time-constrained lifters.

### What's the difference between Heavy Duty and Heavy Duty II?

The original Heavy Duty (1993) is a 3-day Push/Pull/Legs split with pre-exhaust supersets, which is what this program implements. Heavy Duty II (late 1990s) pushed the philosophy further with even less volume and more rest days — a 4-workout rotation with each body part trained roughly once every 8-14 days. Heavy Duty II also introduced the ultra-minimalist Consolidated Routine as a fallback option.

### How long should each Heavy Duty workout take?

Each session typically takes 30-45 minutes including warm-up sets. The actual working volume is very low since you're only doing 5-6 working sets per session. Most of your gym time is spent warming up and resting between exercises.

### Should I use forced reps or negative reps on Heavy Duty?

Start with regular sets to positive failure. Mentzer recommended keeping forced reps and negatives as advanced techniques for when progress stalls — they're not meant to be used every session. If you plateau for 2-3 sessions despite adequate rest, try adding 1-2 forced reps on the last exercise of a superset. Negative reps should be used even more sparingly.
