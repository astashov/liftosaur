A 5-day body part split that dedicates one training session to each major muscle group: chest, back, shoulders, legs, and arms. The most popular training structure in bodybuilding history, the bro split maximizes volume and intensity for each muscle group in a single session while providing a full week of recovery before training it again.

## Origin & Philosophy

The bro split emerged from 1970s and 1980s bodybuilding culture, popularized by Golden Era bodybuilders like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Frank Zane, and Franco Columbu. The name "bro split" was coined later — somewhat mockingly — by the evidence-based fitness community, but the training structure itself has been the backbone of competitive bodybuilding for decades. A [2013 survey of competitive bodybuilders](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22990567/) (Hackett et al.) found that the majority trained each muscle group once per week using body part splits.

The core principle is simple: dedicate an entire session to a single muscle group, exhaust it with high volume from multiple angles and exercises, then give it a full week to recover and grow. The idea is that concentrating all work for a muscle into one session — typically 4-6 exercises, 15-20+ sets — creates a powerful growth stimulus through both mechanical tension and metabolic stress. This is a flexible principle, not a rigid template. The specific exercises, set/rep schemes, and even the exact muscle group divisions can be customized freely. The only rule is one primary muscle group per session.

### The Frequency Debate

In recent years, the bro split has come under criticism from the evidence-based fitness community. The main argument against it centers on training frequency: a [2016 meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/) found that training muscles twice per week produced moderately more hypertrophy than once per week. Since muscle protein synthesis (MPS) peaks after training and returns to baseline within roughly 48 hours, training a muscle once per week leaves several days without elevated MPS — theoretically leaving growth on the table.

A [2015 study (Schoenfeld et al.)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25932981/) directly compared a split routine to a total-body routine in trained men over 8 weeks with matched total volume. The total-body group showed significantly greater forearm flexor growth, with no measure favoring the split group. A [2019 study (Zaroni et al.)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31260419/) found similar results in 18 strength-trained men — spreading the same weekly volume across 5 full-body sessions produced greater bicep and quad thickness than a split routine.

However, the picture is more nuanced than "bro splits don't work." A [2018 study by Gomes et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29489727/) took 23 genuinely intermediate lifters, matched their total weekly volume, and compared a bro split to a higher-frequency program over 8 weeks. The result: **no significant difference in muscle growth or strength** between groups — though the bro split group reported more muscle soreness. Menno Henselmans, [reviewing this study](https://mennohenselmans.com/high-frequency-resistance-training-is-not-more-effective-than-low-frequency-resistance-training-in-increasing-muscle-mass-and-strength-in-well-trained-men/), concluded that "volume is the primary driver of muscle growth, with training frequency playing a secondary role."

There's also the "hidden frequency" argument: compound movements provide overlap across training days. Chest day trains triceps. Back day trains biceps. Shoulder day involves chest and triceps again. So arms and shoulders may actually receive 2-3 weekly stimulations through compound overlap, even in a bro split.

The practical takeaway is that bro splits are effective — they've built more champion physiques than any other training structure in bodybuilding history. Higher-frequency programs may have a moderate edge when total volume is equated, but the difference is smaller than the online discourse suggests. The most important factors remain total weekly volume, progressive overload, consistency, nutrition, and sleep — not the specific split used. As the common saying goes: the best program is the one you'll actually stick with.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (6+ months of consistent training). You should be comfortable performing all major compound movements and have enough work capacity to handle 15-20 sets for a single muscle group.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy (muscle growth). The high per-session volume and exercise variety target muscles from multiple angles, which is ideal for bodybuilding.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. On a cut, recovery will be impaired — consider reducing to 3 sets per exercise or dropping one isolation exercise per day.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Full attention to each muscle group means you can hit it from multiple angles with 4-6 exercises, covering every head and fiber orientation
- One week between sessions for the same muscle provides plenty of recovery time — hard to overtrain
- Mentally simple: walk into the gym knowing "today is chest day" with no complex scheduling to remember
- High volume per session creates a strong pump and metabolic stress, both of which contribute to hypertrophy
- Flexible scheduling — miss a day and you only lose one muscle group, not a mixed session
- Fully customizable: swap any exercise as long as it targets the day's muscle group

**Cons**

- Each muscle group is trained only once per week — [research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/) training 2x per week produces moderately more hypertrophy when total volume is equal, though [other studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29489727/) show the difference vanishes when volume is matched in well-trained lifters
- Sessions can run 60-75+ minutes due to the high per-session volume
- Performance degrades on later exercises as fatigue accumulates within a session — your 5th chest exercise won't be as productive as your 1st
- No direct ab work programmed — you need to add your own
- The 5-day commitment is demanding — missing sessions means a muscle goes 2+ weeks untrained
- Doesn't build compound strength as effectively as programs with higher frequency on main lifts like [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) or [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b)

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Body part (bro split) — Chest / Back / Shoulders / Legs / Arms
- **Periodization**: Double progression on all exercises (add reps within a range, then add weight)
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — typically Mon through Fri with weekends off, though any 5 consecutive or near-consecutive days work
- **Typical week**: Chest → Back → Shoulders → Legs → Arms → Rest → Rest

This implementation provides one well-balanced version, but remember: the bro split is a principle, not a prescription. You can swap exercises freely, rearrange days, add or remove movements, adjust rep ranges, or even change the muscle group divisions (e.g., combining shoulders with chest, or separating hamstrings from quads) — as long as each session focuses primarily on one muscle group.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Chest** opens with [{Bench Press}] as the primary heavy compound — the strongest horizontal press and the best overall chest mass builder. [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] shifts emphasis to the upper (clavicular) chest fibers and adds unilateral balance work. [{Chest Dip}] is a bodyweight compound that emphasizes the lower chest and sternal fibers. [{Chest Fly}] isolates the chest through a full stretch at the bottom of the movement, which research links to greater hypertrophy. [{Cable Crossover}] provides constant tension throughout the range of motion, including peak contraction at the top — something free weight flies cannot do.

**Back** starts with [{Deadlift}] as the heaviest posterior chain movement, building overall back thickness and strength. [{Bent Over Row}] is the primary horizontal pull for mid-back and lat development. [{Lat Pulldown}] provides a vertical pull for lat width. [{Seated Row}] adds a second horizontal pull angle with a more upright torso, hitting the mid-traps and rhomboids differently than bent-over rows. [{Pullover}] stretches the lats under load — one of the few exercises that trains the lats through shoulder extension rather than elbow flexion.

**Shoulders** leads with [{Overhead Press}] as the primary compound press for anterior and lateral delt development. [{Arnold Press}] adds a rotational component that increases time under tension for the lateral and anterior delts. [{Lateral Raise}] is the most direct lateral delt isolation exercise — high volume here is critical since pressing alone doesn't adequately develop the lateral head. [{Face Pull}] targets the rear delts and external rotators, which are essential for shoulder health given the pressing volume in this program. [{Shrug}] isolates the upper traps, which are commonly undertrained in programs that don't include direct trap work.

**Legs** begins with [{Squat}] for overall quad, glute, and core development. [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] targets the hamstrings and glutes through a hip hinge pattern — it complements the squat's quad emphasis. [{Leg Press}] provides additional quad volume without the spinal loading of squats. [{Leg Extension}] isolates the quads — particularly the rectus femoris, which squats and leg press undertrain due to the knee angle. [{Seated Leg Curl}] isolates the hamstrings. [{Standing Calf Raise}] hits the gastrocnemius — calves require high volume and frequency to grow, so 4 sets here is a minimum.

**Arms** pairs biceps and triceps exercises for an efficient session. [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] is the primary bicep mass builder. [{Skullcrusher}] is the primary tricep mass builder, emphasizing the long head under stretch. [{Hammer Curl}] targets the brachialis and brachioradialis for arm thickness. [{Triceps Pushdown}] hits the lateral head of the triceps. [{Preacher Curl}] eliminates momentum and emphasizes the bicep peak. [{Triceps Extension}] (overhead) puts the long head of the triceps under maximal stretch.

**Substitution options**: [{Bench Press}] can be swapped for [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}]. [{Lat Pulldown}] can be replaced with [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]. [{Leg Press}] can be swapped for [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Hack Squat}]. [{Seated Row}] can be replaced with [{T Bar Row}] or [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}]. [{Cable Crossover}] can be swapped for [{Pec Deck}] or [{Chest Fly, Cable}].

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Heavy compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Squat}]): 3-4 sets in the 5-12 rep range. These are loaded heavier to build strength as a foundation for hypertrophy.
- **Secondary compounds** ([{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}], [{Arnold Press}], [{Leg Press}]): 3 sets in the 10-12 rep range. Moderate loads with controlled tempo.
- **Isolation exercises** ([{Chest Fly}], [{Cable Crossover}], [{Lateral Raise}], [{Leg Extension}], [{Preacher Curl}], etc.): 3 sets in the 12-15 rep range. Lighter loads with strict form and full range of motion.

The higher rep ranges on isolation work maximize metabolic stress and time under tension, both drivers of hypertrophy. The lower rep ranges on compounds let you move heavier loads, providing the mechanical tension stimulus.

## Progressive Overload

All exercises use **double progression**: work within a rep range, and when you hit the top-end reps on all sets, add weight and reset to the bottom of the range.

- **Compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Squat}]): Add **5lb** when you complete all sets at the top of the rep range.
- **Deadlift** and [{Leg Press}]: Add **10lb** per successful progression.
- **Isolation exercises**: Add **5lb** per successful progression.

For example, [{Bench Press}] starts at 4x8. Each session you try to add reps: 4x8 → 4x9 → ... → 4x12. Once you complete 4x12, the weight goes up by 5lb and you reset to 4x8 at the new weight.

**When you stall**: If you can't add reps for 2-3 consecutive sessions on an exercise, reduce the weight by 10-15% and build back up. This auto-regulated deload is built into the rep range system — you'll rarely need a dedicated deload week.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the bro split for **8-16 weeks** before reassessing. It's a straightforward program that can be run for months as long as you're progressing. Take a deload week (cut volume in half) every 6-8 weeks if fatigue accumulates.

**Signs it's time to move on**: Stalling on most exercises despite deloads, boredom with single-muscle sessions, or wanting to shift toward strength goals.

**Transition to**: [PHUL](/programs/phul) for an upper/lower split that trains each muscle 2x per week with both power and hypertrophy work. [Metallicadpa PPL](/programs/metallicadpappl) for a 6-day PPL that doubles training frequency. [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) if you want to shift toward strength with a proven periodization model.

## Equipment Needed

- **Barbell and plates** — for bench press, deadlift, overhead press, squat, row, RDL, barbell curl, skullcrusher
- **Dumbbells** — for incline press, flies, lateral raises, Arnold press, shrugs, hammer curls, preacher curls, tricep extensions
- **Cable machine** — for cable crossover, lat pulldown, seated row, face pull, triceps pushdown
- **Leg press, leg extension, and leg curl machines**

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Cable Crossover}] → [{Chest Fly}] (additional dumbbell sets)
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] or [{T Bar Row}]
- [{Face Pull}] → [{Reverse Fly}]
- [{Triceps Pushdown}] → [{Skullcrusher}] (additional sets) or [{Bench Dip}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Front Squat}]
- [{Leg Extension}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Lunge}]
- [{Seated Leg Curl}] → additional [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] sets

## Rest Times

- **Heavy compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Squat}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}]): **2-3 minutes** between sets
- **Secondary compounds** ([{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}], [{Arnold Press}], [{Leg Press}]): **90 seconds**
- **Isolation exercises**: **60 seconds**

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**If you know your 1RM**: Use approximately 65-70% for compound exercises (8-12 rep range) and 50-60% for isolation exercises (12-15 rep range).

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Start with a weight where you can complete all prescribed sets with 2-3 reps in reserve. If the first session feels too easy, add weight next time — the double progression will ramp you up quickly.

**Common mistake**: Going too heavy on isolation exercises. [{Lateral Raise}], [{Chest Fly}], and [{Preacher Curl}] are about controlled movement and full range of motion — sacrificing form for heavier weight reduces their effectiveness.

## Common Modifications

- **Add abs**: Add [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Cable Crunch}] (2-3 sets) at the end of leg day or on a rest day.
- **Add rear delts**: The program already includes [{Face Pull}] on shoulder day. If you want more rear delt volume, add [{Reverse Fly}] on back day.
- **Superset arm day**: Pair bicep and tricep exercises back-to-back (e.g., [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] into [{Skullcrusher}]) to cut session time from ~50 minutes to ~35 minutes.
- **4-day variant**: Merge shoulders into chest day (push focus) and arms into back day (pull focus) for a 4-day split: Chest+Shoulders / Back+Biceps / Rest / Legs / Triceps+Abs.
- **Add a second calf session**: Calves recover fast — add [{Seated Calf Raise}] (3x15) at the end of arm day for extra calf volume.
- **Swap deadlift placement**: If deadlifts on back day drain your energy for rows, move [{Deadlift}] to leg day and replace it with [{T Bar Row}] on back day.
- **Customize exercises**: This is a principle, not a rigid program. Swap any exercise for another that targets the same muscle group — as long as each day focuses on one primary muscle group, it's still a bro split.

### Is the bro split good for beginners?

The bro split works best for intermediate lifters with 6+ months of training experience. Beginners benefit more from higher frequency programs like GZCLP or a basic full-body routine that trains each muscle 2-3 times per week, which builds technique faster and takes advantage of rapid beginner recovery.

### How many days a week is a bro split?

A bro split is a 5-day program: Chest, Back, Shoulders, Legs, and Arms, each on their own day. Most people run it Monday through Friday with weekends off, though any 5-day arrangement works.

### Is a bro split effective for building muscle?

Yes. While research suggests training muscles twice per week is moderately more effective than once per week, bro splits still produce substantial muscle growth. The high per-session volume compensates partially for the lower frequency, and many successful natural bodybuilders have built impressive physiques on bro splits. A 2018 study by Gomes et al. found no significant difference in muscle growth between a bro split and a higher-frequency program when total volume was matched.

### How long should a bro split workout take?

Most sessions run 60-75 minutes including warmups. Back day and leg day tend to be the longest due to heavier compounds and more exercises. Arm day is typically the shortest at around 45-50 minutes.

### Can I do a bro split on a cut?

Yes, but you may need to reduce volume. Drop one isolation exercise per day or reduce set counts from 4 to 3 on compounds. Prioritize maintaining the weight on compound lifts over everything else — accessories can take the hit.

### What's the difference between a bro split and PPL?

A bro split trains each muscle once per week across 5 days (one muscle per day). Push/Pull/Legs trains each muscle twice per week across 6 days by grouping muscles into pushing, pulling, and leg movements. PPL has higher training frequency; the bro split has higher per-session volume.

### How do I progress on a bro split?

This program uses double progression: work within a rep range (e.g., 8-12) and when you hit the top reps on all sets, add weight and reset to the bottom of the range. For example, Bench Press goes 4x8 → 4x9 → ... → 4x12, then add 5 lbs and reset to 4x8.

### Should I add cardio to a bro split?

You can add 20-30 minutes of low-intensity cardio on rest days or after your lifting sessions without impacting recovery. Avoid intense cardio before leg day, as it can compromise squat and Romanian deadlift performance.
