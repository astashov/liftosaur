A beginner linear progression program that adds dedicated pulling exercises (chin-ups and rows) to every session. Two alternating full-body workouts, 3 days per week, with AMRAP last sets that autoregulate intensity and drive an accelerated progression system. [{Deadlift}] uses a single heavy AMRAP set to keep sessions short.

## Origin & Philosophy

Phrakture (a moderator of Reddit's r/Fitness community) created this variant of the Greyskull LP program, originally designed by John Sheaffer (a.k.a. Johnny Pain). The original GSLP had only pressing and lower body movements as main lifts, leaving a gap in back training. Phrakture's modification adds [{Chin Up}] and [{Bent Over Row}] to every session, creating a balanced push/pull/legs structure.

The core philosophy inherited from GSLP: every working set scheme ends with an AMRAP set. When you eventually stall and deload 10%, you hit the lighter weights for higher reps on the way back up — turning deloads into hypertrophy phases rather than wasted time.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Complete beginners (0-6 months of lifting) or lifters returning after a long break
- **Goal**: Build foundational strength on barbell compounds while learning proper technique
- **Diet**: Works on any diet — beginners gain strength even in a deficit

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Vertical push/pull ([{Overhead Press}] + [{Chin Up}]) and horizontal push/pull ([{Bench Press}] + [{Bent Over Row}]) on alternating days builds balanced upper body development
- AMRAP last sets auto-regulate intensity — good days reward you with more volume, bad days naturally limit it
- Single [{Deadlift}] set keeps deadlift-day sessions under 30 minutes while still providing heavy stimulus
- Accelerated progression (double weight jump at 10+ AMRAP reps) prevents the early weeks from feeling too easy

**Cons**

- No direct arm, shoulder, or core isolation — add your own curls, face pulls, and ab work if you want more
- Only 1 working set of [{Deadlift}] per session — some lifters feel this is too little volume to develop good technique
- 2.5lb upper body jumps require microplates (1.25lb each side) that most gyms don't stock
- [{Chin Up}] at bodyweight has no deload path — if you can't do 5 reps, you need to substitute with [{Lat Pulldown}] or negatives

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, A/B alternating
- **Periodization**: Linear progression with AMRAP-driven acceleration and 10% deloads on failure
- **Rotation**: Week 1 = A/B/A, Week 2 = B/A/B, repeat

A typical two-week cycle on Monday/Wednesday/Friday:

| | Monday | Wednesday | Friday |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|
| Week 1 | Workout A | Workout B | Workout A |
| Week 2 | Workout B | Workout A | Workout B |

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Workout A** pairs vertical movements: [{Overhead Press}] (vertical push) + [{Chin Up}] (vertical pull) + [{Squat}] (quad-dominant lower). The vertical pairing ensures balanced shoulder and lat development in a single session.

**Workout B** pairs horizontal movements: [{Bench Press}] (horizontal push) + [{Bent Over Row}] (horizontal pull) + [{Deadlift}] (hip-dominant lower). Rows directly strengthen the upper back muscles that stabilize your bench press.

[{Squat}] appears in 2 of every 3 sessions while [{Deadlift}] appears in 1 of 3 — reflecting the higher recovery demands of heavy deadlifts.

**Substitutions**: Replace [{Chin Up}] with [{Lat Pulldown}] if you can't do bodyweight chin-ups yet. [{Bent Over Row}] can be any barbell row variant — Phrakture personally recommends Yates rows (slightly more upright, underhand grip).

## Set & Rep Scheme

All exercises use **2x5, 1x5+** — two straight sets of 5 reps, then one AMRAP set. The exception is [{Deadlift}], which uses **1x5+** — a single AMRAP set.

The AMRAP set means "as many reps as possible with good form." Stop at RPE 8-9 (1-2 reps left in the tank). Don't grind to absolute failure. The AMRAP number drives the progression system — it tells you whether to increase weight normally, increase it faster, or deload.

## Progressive Overload

**After each successful session** (all prescribed reps completed):

| Lift type | Standard increase | Accelerated increase (10+ AMRAP reps) |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Upper body ([{Overhead Press}], [{Bench Press}], [{Chin Up}], [{Bent Over Row}]) | +2.5lb | +5lb |
| Lower body ([{Squat}], [{Deadlift}]) | +5lb | +10lb |

**On failure** (didn't complete all reps): reduce weight by **10%** and work back up.

Each exercise progresses independently. Stalling on [{Bench Press}] doesn't affect [{Squat}].

The deload-and-rebuild cycle is a feature, not a bug: hitting lighter weights for higher AMRAP reps on the way back up provides a hypertrophy stimulus that builds the muscle needed to break through the plateau.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run it for **2-4 months**. Move on when you're deloading on multiple lifts frequently and your AMRAP sets barely hit 5 reps.

**Good next programs**:
- [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) — adds tiered exercise structure with more volume
- [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b) — periodized progression with built-in assistance work

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, weight plates, squat rack, flat bench
- Pull-up bar or [{Lat Pulldown}] machine
- **Microplates** (1.25lb each) for 2.5lb total jumps — buy your own if the gym doesn't have them, or use 5lb jumps and expect more frequent deloads

**Home gym substitutions**: If you can't do [{Chin Up}], use band-assisted chin-ups or [{Inverted Row}] as a substitute.

## Rest Times

- **Between sets**: 2-3 minutes
- **Between exercises**: 3-5 minutes
- Heavy [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] may need the full 5 minutes; [{Chin Up}] and [{Bent Over Row}] are fine with 2 minutes

## How to Pick Starting Weights

For each exercise on your first day:

1. Start with the empty bar (45lb) for 5 reps
2. Add 10-20lb, do 5 reps
3. Repeat until form starts to break down or bar speed noticeably slows
4. Use that weight as your starting point

**Start lighter than you think.** Linear progression adds weight every session — you'll reach challenging weights within 2-3 weeks. Starting too heavy leads to early deloads.

[{Chin Up}]: Start at bodyweight (0lb added). Once you can complete all sets, add weight in 2.5lb increments via a dip belt.

[{Deadlift}]: Start at 95lb minimum — you need 25lb plates on each side for proper bar height off the floor.

## Common Modifications

- **Add accessories**: After the main lifts, do 2-3 sets each of a push, pull, and core exercise. Good picks: [{Face Pull}] (2x15-20), [{Bicep Curl}] (2x10-12), [{Hanging Leg Raise}] (2x10-15).
- **Can't do chin-ups**: Use [{Lat Pulldown}] at 2x8, 1x8+ with the same progression scheme until you can do bodyweight reps.
- **No microplates**: Use 5lb jumps for upper body. You'll deload more often but still progress.
- **More deadlift volume**: Add working sets (making it 2x5, 1x5+) if you feel the single AMRAP set isn't enough practice. This is what the r/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine does.

<!-- faq -->

### Is Phrak's Greyskull LP good for beginners?

Yes, it's one of the most recommended beginner barbell programs. It adds dedicated pulling work (chin-ups and rows) to every session — something most beginner programs lack. The AMRAP last sets provide built-in autoregulation and make deloads productive rather than wasted time.

### How many days a week is Phrak's Greyskull LP?

It's a 3-day program trained on non-consecutive days, typically Monday/Wednesday/Friday. Two alternating workouts (A and B) rotate each session, so Week 1 is A/B/A and Week 2 is B/A/B.

### How is Phrak's Greyskull LP different from Starting Strength?

Phrak's GSLP includes chin-ups and rows in every session, uses AMRAP last sets instead of straight sets of 5, and has an accelerated progression rule (double the weight jump at 10+ AMRAP reps). Starting Strength uses only 3x5 straight sets and doesn't include pulling exercises until Phase 3.

### What do I do when I stall on Phrak's Greyskull LP?

When you fail to complete all prescribed reps on an exercise, reduce the weight by 10% and work back up. The deload is a feature — hitting lighter weights for higher AMRAP reps on the way back up provides a hypertrophy stimulus that helps you break through the plateau.

### How long should I run Phrak's Greyskull LP?

Run it for 2-4 months. Move on when you're deloading on multiple lifts frequently and your AMRAP sets barely hit 5 reps. Good next programs include [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) or [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b).

### Can I add accessories to Phrak's Greyskull LP?

Yes. After the main lifts, add 2-3 sets each of face pulls, bicep curls, and hanging leg raises at 10-15 reps. Keep accessories light and don't let them interfere with recovery for the main lifts.
