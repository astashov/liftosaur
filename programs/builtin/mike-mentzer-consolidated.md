Mike Mentzer's Consolidated Routine is the most extreme expression of High Intensity Training (HIT) ever devised. Just 4 total exercises split across 2 workouts, with 1 working set per exercise taken to absolute muscular failure, alternated once per week. Published in *Heavy Duty II* in the late 1990s, it represents Mentzer's answer to the question: "What is the minimum amount of training required to stimulate maximum muscular growth?"

### Origin & Philosophy

Mike Mentzer (1951–2001) developed the Consolidated Routine as the final evolution of his Heavy Duty training system, published in *Heavy Duty II* in the late 1990s. Where [Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty](/programs/mike-mentzer-heavy-duty) used pre-exhaust supersets across 5-6 exercises per session 3 days per week, the Consolidated Routine strips training to the absolute bare minimum: 2 compound exercises per workout, 1 working set each, performed once per week.

The theoretical foundation is Mentzer's concept of the **Indirect Effect**: heavy compound movements trigger a systemic hormonal and neurological response that stimulates growth throughout the entire body, not just the muscles directly worked. A maximal set of deadlifts doesn't just grow your posterior chain — it triggers growth in your arms, shoulders, and chest through systemic mechanisms. This is why, in Mentzer's view, isolation exercises are unnecessary: they add recovery cost without meaningful additional stimulus.

Mentzer's guiding principle: "More exercise beyond what is minimally required is not only unnecessary — it's counterproductive." As trainees grow stronger and handle heavier loads, they don't need more training — they need less.

### Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Advanced (2+ years of consistent, intense training)
- **Prerequisites**: Must be experienced with training to absolute muscular failure. Must have excellent form on heavy compound lifts. Should have already run a program like [Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty](/programs/mike-mentzer-heavy-duty) first.
- **Primary goal**: Strength and hypertrophy via minimal effective dose
- **Suitability**: Excellent during a cut when recovery capacity is limited. Works well for lifters who are overtrained from high-volume programs and need a drastic reduction.

### Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Sessions take 15-25 minutes including warm-ups — just 2 working sets per workout
- Ideal for natural lifters who plateau on high-volume programs — the extreme rest allows full recovery
- Forces you to develop the skill of true maximum-effort training — every rep matters when you only get 1 set
- Zero decision fatigue: 2 exercises, 1 set each, done
- Excellent recovery phase between more demanding programs

**Cons**

- Zero direct arm, shoulder, and chest work — you're relying entirely on the Indirect Effect for those muscle groups, which is not well-supported by modern research
- No direct work for rear delts, abs, calves, hamstrings, or upper back beyond what the compounds provide
- Only 1-2 working sets per muscle group per 2-week cycle — well below the 10-20 weekly sets most research suggests for optimal hypertrophy
- Mentally difficult to accept doing nothing for a full week between workouts — many trainees add volume out of anxiety, defeating the purpose
- Progression stalls require adding more rest days (training even less), which feels counterintuitive

### Program Structure

- **Split type**: Full body, divided into two workouts
- **Periodization**: Auto-regulated via double progression (add reps to failure, increase weight when you hit the top of the rep range)
- **Schedule**: 2 workouts alternated once per week. Week 1 do Workout A, Week 2 do Workout B, repeat. If you're not getting stronger each workout, extend rest to 10-14 days between sessions.
- Each workout pairs one lower-body compound with one upper-body compound for full-body coverage

### Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Workout A**: [{Squat}] is the primary lower body push — Mentzer considered it the most productive exercise for overall systemic growth stimulus, working quads, glutes, and core. [{Lat Pulldown}] with a close underhand (palms-up) grip provides the upper body pull — Mentzer specified this grip to simulate chin-ups with greater control and lat emphasis, also hitting biceps indirectly.

**Workout B**: [{Deadlift}] is the primary lower body pull — it provides the strongest possible posterior chain stimulus and the greatest systemic hormonal response of any exercise, hitting glutes, hamstrings, lower back, traps, and grip. [{Triceps Dip}] is the upper body push — Mentzer called this "the upper body squat" because it hits chest, triceps, and anterior deltoids in one movement with heavy loads.

The pairing logic is deliberate: each workout balances a push with a pull, and lower body with upper body. [{Squat}] (legs/push) pairs with [{Lat Pulldown}] (upper/pull); [{Deadlift}] (legs/pull) pairs with [{Triceps Dip}] (upper/push).

**Substitutions**: [{Leg Press}] can replace [{Squat}]. [{Chin Up}] can replace [{Lat Pulldown}] if you have a pull-up bar but no lat pulldown machine. [{Bench Press Close Grip}] can replace [{Triceps Dip}] if you don't have a dip station.

### Set & Rep Scheme

Every exercise is performed for **1 working set to absolute muscular failure**:

- [{Squat}]: 8-15 reps. Higher rep range because it's harder to achieve true local muscular failure on legs at low reps — cardiovascular fatigue often becomes the limiter.
- [{Deadlift}]: 5-8 reps. Lower rep range reflects the heavy, CNS-intensive nature of the movement.
- [{Lat Pulldown}] and [{Triceps Dip}]: 6-10 reps. Standard HIT rep range for upper body compounds.

Mentzer prescribed a controlled rep tempo: approximately 2-4 seconds concentric, brief pause at peak contraction, 4-5 seconds eccentric. No momentum, no bouncing, no cheating. Perform 1-3 warm-up sets at lighter weights before each exercise, never approaching failure on the warm-ups.

### Progressive Overload

**Double progression** within each rep range:

1. Start at the bottom of the rep range with a weight that takes you to failure at that rep count.
2. Each workout, attempt to get more reps with the same weight. Train to absolute failure every time.
3. When you hit the top of the rep range (e.g., 10 reps on a 6-10 range), increase the weight by 5-10lb and drop back to the bottom of the range.
4. Repeat.

**When you stall**: If you are not stronger (more reps or more weight) at every single workout, you are not yet recovered. Add more rest days between sessions. Do not add more volume. Some trainees on this program eventually train as infrequently as once every 10-14 days per workout.

### How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the Consolidated Routine for **6-12 weeks**. Signs it's working: you're setting rep or weight PRs at every session. Signs it's time to move on:

- You've exhausted the recovery benefits and want more volume to drive further hypertrophy
- Lack of direct arm/shoulder/ab/calf work is creating noticeable imbalances
- You miss training more frequently

Transition to [Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty](/programs/mike-mentzer-heavy-duty) for more exercise variety while staying within HIT principles, or to [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) for higher volume and submaximal training.

### Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates (for [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}])
- Lat pulldown machine (substitute: [{Chin Up}] or [{Pull Up}])
- Dip station or parallel bars (substitute: [{Bench Press Close Grip}])

For a home gym with just a barbell and pull-up bar: replace [{Lat Pulldown}] with [{Chin Up}] and [{Triceps Dip}] with [{Bench Press Close Grip}].

### Rest Times

- **Between exercises**: 1-3 minutes, or until you feel fully recovered enough for maximum effort on the next set
- **Between workouts**: 7-10 days minimum. Start with one workout per week. If you're not progressing, extend to 10-14 days per workout.

### How to Pick Starting Weights

1. For each exercise, pick a weight that takes you to absolute failure at the bottom of the rep range (6 reps for upper body, 8 reps for squats, 5 reps for deadlifts).
2. Be conservative — it's better to start lighter and add reps quickly than to fail below the minimum rep target.
3. If you know your 1RM: use approximately 75-80% for 6-rep exercises, 65-70% for 8-rep exercises.
4. If you've been running [Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty](/programs/mike-mentzer-heavy-duty), your working weights should transfer directly since the rep ranges and intensity are identical.

### Common Modifications

- **The 3-exercise expanded version**: Some sources attribute a slightly expanded variant to Mentzer: Workout A adds [{Behind The Neck Press}] (or [{Overhead Press}]), Workout B adds [{Standing Calf Raise}]. This covers shoulders and calves directly at the cost of slightly more recovery demand.
- **Rest-pause variation**: Instead of a straight set to failure, do 1 maximal rep, rest 10 seconds, do another rep, rest 10 seconds, reduce weight 20%, do 2 more reps. Total: ~4 reps at near-maximal effort each.
- **Extending to Heavy Duty**: If you want more volume while keeping HIT principles, transition to [Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty](/programs/mike-mentzer-heavy-duty) which adds pre-exhaust supersets and isolation exercises.

### Is Mike Mentzer's Consolidated Routine good for beginners?

No. The Consolidated Routine requires advanced training maturity — you must know how to push to true absolute muscular failure with perfect form on heavy compound lifts. Beginners should start with a structured beginner program and train for at least 1-2 years before attempting this level of intensity with this little volume.

### Can you really build muscle training once a week?

Mentzer and many practitioners report significant muscle and strength gains on once-per-week training. The key is that each set must be a true all-out maximal effort. Some research supports that even low-volume training can produce hypertrophy, though most evidence suggests higher volume (10-20 sets per week per muscle group) produces better results for most people.

### What's the difference between Heavy Duty and the Consolidated Routine?

Heavy Duty (the Ideal Routine) uses 5-6 exercises per session with pre-exhaust supersets, 3 days per week — about 15 total working sets across 3 workouts. The Consolidated Routine uses just 2 exercises per session, 1 set each, once per week — 2 total working sets per workout. The Consolidated Routine is the final, most extreme evolution of Mentzer's HIT philosophy.

### How many sets should I do on the Consolidated Routine?

Exactly 1 working set per exercise, taken to complete muscular failure. That's 2 working sets per workout total. You should also perform 1-3 warm-up sets per exercise at lighter weights, but these warm-up sets must never approach failure — they exist only to prepare joints and the nervous system.

### What if I stop getting stronger on the Consolidated Routine?

Add more rest days between workouts. If you're training once per week and not progressing, try once every 10-14 days. Do not add more exercises or sets — Mentzer was adamant that staleness means you need more recovery, not more stimulation. If extending rest still doesn't help after several weeks, transition to a different program.

### Can I add more exercises to the Consolidated Routine?

You can, but doing so changes the program's nature. Some sources describe a 3-exercise variant that adds an overhead press and calf raises. If you want significantly more exercise variety while staying within HIT principles, run Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty (the Ideal Routine) instead, which includes pre-exhaust supersets and isolation exercises.

### How long does a Consolidated Routine workout take?

Including warm-up sets and rest between exercises, expect the full session to take 15-25 minutes. The actual working volume is just 2 sets to failure — most of your gym time is spent warming up. This is one of the shortest workout programs ever designed.
