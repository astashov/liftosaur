A 4-day upper/lower hypertrophy program built specifically around the equipment available at Planet Fitness — dumbbells, selectorized machines, plate-loaded machines, cables, and the Smith machine. Every exercise was selected to be available at standard PF locations, with no barbell movements required. Each muscle group is trained twice per week across two upper and two lower sessions, using double progression to manage the larger weight jumps inherent to dumbbells and machines.

## Origin & Philosophy

This program exists because Planet Fitness is the largest gym chain in the United States with over 2,600 locations, yet most popular hypertrophy programs assume access to barbells that PF doesn't provide. The "judgement-free zone" stocks dumbbells (typically up to 70-75lb), a wide variety of selectorized and plate-loaded machines, cable stations, and Smith machines — but no free-weight barbells, no power racks, and no platforms for conventional barbell lifts.

Rather than force-fitting a barbell program into PF's equipment, this program was designed from the ground up to take advantage of what PF does well: extensive machine variety. Machines provide consistent resistance curves, guide movement patterns for newer lifters, and allow safe training to near-failure without a spotter — all of which support hypertrophy. The 4-day upper/lower split ensures each muscle group receives two weekly training stimuli, which a [2016 meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/) found produces moderately more hypertrophy than once-per-week training.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Beginner to intermediate (3+ months of consistent training). The machine-heavy exercise selection makes this accessible to newer lifters, while the volume and progression scheme challenge intermediates.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy (muscle growth). The rep ranges (8-12 for compounds, 12-15 for isolation) sit squarely in the hypertrophy zone.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases at Planet Fitness. If cutting, reduce each exercise by 1 set to manage recovery.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Every exercise is available at standard Planet Fitness locations — no equipment substitutions needed
- Machine-heavy selection guides movement patterns, making it safe for newer lifters to train close to failure without a spotter
- Each muscle group is hit twice per week, which is superior to once-per-week splits for hypertrophy
- Double progression handles the 5lb dumbbell jumps and machine stack increments smoothly — you build up reps before adding weight
- 4-day schedule fits easily into most work weeks with built-in rest days
- Includes direct work for commonly neglected areas: rear delts, calves, abs, and hip abductors

**Cons**

- Dumbbell weights cap around 70-75lb at most PF locations — advanced lifters will eventually max out on dumbbell pressing movements
- Smith machine squats don't develop stabilizer muscles or core bracing as effectively as free-weight barbell squats
- No barbell deadlift, bench press, squat, or overhead press — if you want to build competition-style powerlifting strength, this program won't get you there
- Machine availability during peak hours at PF can be limited, sometimes requiring exercise order flexibility
- The fixed 5lb dumbbell jumps can be too aggressive for smaller isolation movements like lateral raises

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Upper/Lower — two upper body days and two lower body days per week
- **Periodization**: Double progression on all exercises — add reps within a range, then increase weight and reset to the bottom of the range
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — Upper A, Lower A, rest, Upper B, Lower B, rest, rest (or any arrangement with at least one rest day between same-type sessions)
- **Typical week**: Mon Upper A → Tue Lower A → Wed Rest → Thu Upper B → Fri Lower B → Sat/Sun Rest

Upper A and Upper B use different exercises for the same muscle groups, providing variety while ensuring each muscle is trained with distinct movement patterns and equipment. The same principle applies to Lower A and Lower B.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Upper A** opens with [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] as the primary chest compound — dumbbells require more stabilization than machines and allow a deeper stretch at the bottom. [{Lat Pulldown}] provides the primary vertical pull for back width. [{Shoulder Press, Leverage Machine}] covers overhead pressing for anterior and lateral delt development. [{Seated Row}] adds a horizontal pull for mid-back thickness. [{Triceps Pushdown}] and [{Bicep Curl, Cable}] provide direct arm work to finish the session.

**Lower A** leads with [{Leg Press}] as the primary quad-dominant compound — the best heavy pressing movement available at PF for the lower body. [{Romanian Deadlift}] (dumbbell) targets the posterior chain through a hip hinge pattern, building hamstring and glute mass. [{Hack Squat}] adds a second quad-dominant movement from a different angle. [{Lying Leg Curl}] isolates the hamstrings. [{Standing Calf Raise, Leverage Machine}] hits the gastrocnemius, and [{Cable Crunch}] provides direct ab work.

**Upper B** flips the emphasis by leading with [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}] and [{Seated Row, Leverage Machine}] — machine compounds provide consistent resistance and let you push hard without worrying about dumbbell stability fatigue from Upper A. [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] shifts the chest emphasis to the upper (clavicular) fibers. [{Lateral Raise, Leverage Machine}] directly targets the lateral deltoid head with a different resistance profile than dumbbells. [{Hammer Curl}] hits the brachialis for arm thickness, and [{Triceps Extension, Cable}] works the long head of the triceps under stretch.

**Lower B** starts with [{Squat, Smith Machine}] — the Smith machine provides a guided squat pattern that's safe without a spotter and still drives quad and glute growth. [{Cable Pull Through}] is a hip hinge that targets the glutes and hamstrings using the cable station available at every PF location. [{Leg Extension}] isolates the quads, particularly the rectus femoris which squats undertrain. [{Seated Leg Curl}] provides hamstring isolation from a different position than the lying curl on Lower A. [{Hip Abductor}] targets the gluteus medius and outer hip — often neglected but important for hip stability and glute development. [{Seated Calf Raise, Leverage Machine}] hits the soleus muscle, complementing the gastrocnemius emphasis of standing calf raises on Lower A.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Primary compounds** ([{Leg Press}], [{Squat, Smith Machine}]): 4 sets in the 8-12 rep range. Heavier loads with controlled tempo provide the mechanical tension stimulus for hypertrophy.
- **Secondary compounds** ([{Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Shoulder Press, Leverage Machine}], [{Seated Row}], [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}], [{Seated Row, Leverage Machine}], [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Romanian Deadlift}], [{Hack Squat}], [{Cable Pull Through}]): 3 sets in the 8-12 rep range. Moderate loads with emphasis on muscle connection.
- **Isolation exercises** ([{Lateral Raise, Leverage Machine}], [{Lying Leg Curl}], [{Leg Extension}], [{Hip Abductor}], etc.): 2-3 sets in the 12-15 rep range. Lighter loads, strict form, and full range of motion to maximize metabolic stress and time under tension.
- **Calves**: 3 sets in the 12-20 rep range — calves are endurance-oriented muscles that respond better to higher reps and volume.

## Progressive Overload

All exercises use **double progression**: work within a rep range, and when you hit the top-end reps on all sets, add weight and reset to the bottom of the range.

- **Leg Press and Hack Squat**: Add **10lb** per successful progression. These machines handle larger jumps well.
- **All other exercises**: Add **5lb** per successful progression.

For example, [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] starts at 4x8 with a range of 8-12. Each session you try to add reps: 4x8 → 4x9 → ... → 4x12. Once you complete 4x12, the weight goes up by 5lb per dumbbell and you reset to 4x8 at the new weight.

The double progression model is particularly well-suited to PF because dumbbell increments are fixed at 5lb (there are no 1.25lb or 2.5lb micro-plates). By building from the bottom to the top of a rep range before adding weight, you give yourself a 50% rep buffer to absorb the relatively large 5lb jumps.

**When you stall**: If you can't add reps for 2-3 consecutive sessions, reduce the weight by 10-15% and build back up. The wide rep range in double progression means true stalls are rare — most lifters progress steadily for months.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run this program for **12-16 weeks** before reassessing. Take a deload week (cut volume in half) every 6-8 weeks if fatigue accumulates.

**Signs it's time to move on**: Maxing out the dumbbell rack on pressing movements, stalling on most machine exercises despite deloads, or wanting to train with barbells.

**If staying at Planet Fitness**: Increase total volume by adding 1 set to compound movements, add intensity techniques (drop sets on machines, which are easy to execute by moving the pin), or transition to a [Bro Split](/programs/bro-split)-style 5-day program adapted for PF equipment.

**If switching to a full gym**: [PHUL](/programs/phul) is a natural transition — same upper/lower structure but with barbell compounds. [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) or [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b) if you want to develop barbell strength. [Metallicadpa PPL](/programs/metallicadpappl) if you want to increase training frequency to 6 days.

## Equipment Needed

This program uses only equipment available at standard Planet Fitness locations:

- **Dumbbells** — for bench press, incline bench press, Romanian deadlift, lateral raises, hammer curls
- **Selectorized machines** — lat pulldown, seated row, pec deck, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, calf raise, hip abductor, lateral raise machine
- **Plate-loaded machines** — hack squat (availability varies by location — see Common Modifications), chest press, shoulder press, seated row
- **Cable stations** — bicep curls, triceps pushdown, triceps extension, cable pull through, cable crunch
- **Smith machine** — squats

No barbells, power racks, or specialty equipment required.

**If training at a non-PF gym** (hotel, apartment, home gym):
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Goblet Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]
- [{Hack Squat}] → [{Goblet Squat}] or [{Front Squat}]
- [{Pec Deck}] → [{Chest Fly}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}]
- [{Squat, Smith Machine}] → [{Goblet Squat}] or [{Squat, Dumbbell}]
- [{Cable Crunch}] → [{Crunch}] or [{Hanging Leg Raise}]

## Rest Times

- **Compounds** ([{Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Leg Press}], [{Squat, Smith Machine}], [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}], [{Seated Row, Leverage Machine}], [{Shoulder Press, Leverage Machine}], [{Seated Row}], [{Romanian Deadlift}], [{Hack Squat}], [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Cable Pull Through}]): **60-90 seconds** between sets
- **Isolation exercises**: **60 seconds**

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**If you know your ability**: Start with a weight where you can complete all prescribed sets at the bottom of the rep range with 2-3 reps in reserve. The first session should feel moderate, not maximal. Double progression will ramp you up quickly.

**If you're brand new**: Use the first week as a testing week. Pick a light weight, perform the prescribed reps, and note whether you could have done 3+ more reps (too light), 1-2 more reps (just right), or you barely finished (too heavy). Adjust the next session accordingly.

**Common mistake**: Starting too heavy on machine exercises because the weight stack doesn't "feel" heavy. Machines eliminate stabilization demands, so you can move more weight — but that doesn't mean you should. Focus on controlled reps with full range of motion, especially on [{Pec Deck}], [{Leg Extension}], and [{Seated Leg Curl}].

## Common Modifications

- **Hack squat unavailable**: Replace [{Hack Squat}] with [{Goblet Squat}] or [{Leg Press}] (add a second leg press variation with feet placed higher on the platform for glute emphasis).
- **Want heavier glute work**: If your PF has a hip thrust machine, replace [{Cable Pull Through}] with [{Hip Thrust, Leverage Machine}] for heavier loading.
- **Add more ab work**: Add [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Crunch}] (2-3 sets) at the end of Lower B.
- **Time-saving supersets**: Pair pushing and pulling exercises on upper days (e.g., [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] with [{Lat Pulldown}]) to cut session time by 10-15 minutes without reducing volume.
- **3-day variant**: Combine Upper A and Lower A into a full-body day, then run Upper B and Lower B as written. Schedule: Full Body → Rest → Upper B → Lower B → Rest.
- **Dumbbell weight maxed out**: When you can complete all sets at the top of the rep range with the heaviest available dumbbell, switch to a slower tempo (3 seconds down, 1 second up) or add a 1-2 second pause at the stretch position to increase difficulty without adding weight.
- **More rear delt volume**: Add [{Face Pull}] (3x12) or [{Reverse Fly, Leverage Machine}] (2x15) at the end of either upper day.

<!-- faq -->

### Is the Planet Fitness Hypertrophy program good for beginners?

Yes, this program is well-suited for beginners with at least a few months of gym experience. The machine-heavy exercise selection guides movement patterns and reduces injury risk compared to free-weight programs. The double progression system is simple to follow — just try to add one rep each session until you hit the top of the range, then add weight.

### Can you actually build muscle at Planet Fitness?

Absolutely. Muscle growth requires progressive overload, sufficient volume, and adequate nutrition — not specific equipment. Planet Fitness provides dumbbells, machines, and cables that cover all major muscle groups. This program delivers 16-20 sets per muscle group per week across two sessions, which falls well within the evidence-based range for hypertrophy.

### How many days a week is this program?

This is a 4-day program: two upper body days and two lower body days. A typical schedule is Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday with Wednesday and weekends as rest days, though any arrangement with at least one rest day between same-type sessions works.

### What do I do when I max out the dumbbell rack at Planet Fitness?

Most Planet Fitness locations stock dumbbells up to 70-75 lbs. When you reach the top of the rack on exercises like Dumbbell Bench Press, switch to a slower tempo (3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up), increase the set count by 1-2, or transition to a heavier machine variation like the Chest Press machine with more weight.

### How long should each workout take?

Upper body sessions run approximately 40-45 minutes, and lower body sessions run approximately 50-55 minutes, including warmup sets. If you're short on time, supersetting push and pull exercises on upper days can shave 10-15 minutes off the session.

### Does this program include abs and cardio?

The program includes Cable Crunches on Lower A for direct ab work, plus compounds like Leg Press and Squat that engage the core. Cardio is not prescribed but can be added — 20-30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (incline treadmill walking, elliptical) on rest days or after lifting sessions is a common addition that won't impair recovery.

### Can I run this program on a caloric deficit?

Yes, but consider reducing each exercise by one set to manage recovery. Prioritize maintaining your weights on compound movements — if strength drops significantly on a cut, you're likely in too large a deficit or not sleeping enough. Isolation exercises can absorb more regression without concern.

### What's the difference between Upper A and Upper B?

Upper A emphasizes dumbbell pressing (Dumbbell Bench Press) and cable back work (Lat Pulldown, Seated Row), plus Shoulder Press for overhead pushing. Upper B uses machine pressing (Chest Press, Dumbbell Incline Press) and a leverage Seated Row for back. Both days include direct arm work and train all upper body muscles with different exercises for varied stimulus.
