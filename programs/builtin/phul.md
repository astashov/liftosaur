A 4-day upper/lower split that trains each muscle group twice per week — once for strength (3-5 reps) and once for hypertrophy (8-12 reps). Created by Brandon Campbell, PHUL bridges the gap between powerlifting and bodybuilding for intermediate lifters who want to get both stronger and bigger.

## Origin & Philosophy

PHUL (Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower) was created by Brandon Campbell and published on [Muscle & Strength](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout). The core idea: research shows muscle protein synthesis stays elevated for about 48 hours after training, so hitting each muscle group twice per week — rather than once — maximizes growth stimulus across the training week.

The program splits each muscle group's weekly work into two distinct sessions with different goals. Power days use heavy compound lifts in the 3-5 rep range to build maximal strength and neuromuscular efficiency. Hypertrophy days use moderate loads in the 8-12 rep range to accumulate volume and metabolic stress. The strength gains from power days let you use heavier weights on hypertrophy days, driving more growth over time.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (1-3 years of consistent training). You should be comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}] form before starting.
- **Primary goal**: Simultaneous strength and hypertrophy ("powerbuilding").
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. Can work on a cut, but recovery will be harder — consider dropping to 3 sets on all exercises if cutting.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Each muscle group is trained twice per week, which research supports as superior to once-per-week training for hypertrophy
- Power days build the strength foundation that lets you lift heavier on hypertrophy days
- 4 days per week is manageable for most schedules while still providing enough volume
- Simple to understand — no complex periodization or percentage calculations required

**Cons**

- [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] on the same day (Lower Power) is brutally fatiguing — sessions can run 75+ minutes
- No direct ab work is programmed — you need to add your own on rest days or at the end of sessions
- No planned deload or failure protocol — you have to self-regulate, which requires experience
- The program doesn't specify percentages or RPE, so you need to already have a sense of appropriate loading

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Upper/Lower
- **Days per week**: 4
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri (with Wed and weekends off)
- **Cycle length**: Single repeating week
- **Session duration**: 60-75 minutes (Lower Power can run longer)
- **Typical week**: Upper Power → Lower Power → Rest → Upper Hypertrophy → Lower Hypertrophy → Rest → Rest

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Upper Power** opens with [{Bench Press}] and [{Bent Over Row}] as the primary horizontal push/pull pair in the 3-5 rep range — these are the heaviest upper body movements of the week. [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] and [{Lat Pulldown}] follow as secondary push/pull in a moderate rep range, adding volume without the same CNS demand. [{Overhead Press}] covers vertical pressing. [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] and [{Skullcrusher}] provide direct arm work at the end.

**Lower Power** pairs [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] — the two heaviest lower body movements — at low reps for maximal strength development. [{Leg Press}] adds quad volume at higher reps where fatigue from squats and deadlifts won't limit you. [{Lying Leg Curl}] directly targets the hamstrings. [{Standing Calf Raise}] finishes the session.

**Upper Hypertrophy** shifts to moderate weight and higher reps. [{Incline Bench Press}] (barbell this time) provides a different pressing angle from the power day. [{Chest Fly}] isolates the chest through a stretch-focused movement. [{Seated Row}] and [{Bent Over One Arm Row}] cover horizontal pulling with different grips and unilateral balance. [{Lateral Raise}] adds direct lateral delt work missing from the power day. [{Incline Curl}] hits biceps at a longer muscle length than standard curls, and [{Triceps Extension, Cable}] provides constant tension through the full range.

**Lower Hypertrophy** uses [{Front Squat}] instead of back squat — it shifts emphasis to the quads and is less taxing on the lower back after the heavy power day. [{Lunge}] adds a unilateral movement for balance and stability. [{Leg Extension}] and [{Seated Leg Curl}] isolate quads and hamstrings respectively. [{Seated Calf Raise}] targets the soleus (bent-knee), while [{Calf Press on Leg Press}] hits the gastrocnemius through a different angle than standing raises.

**Substitution options**: [{Bent Over Row}] can be swapped for [{Pendlay Row}] or [{T Bar Row}]. [{Lat Pulldown}] can be replaced with [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]. [{Lying Leg Curl}] and [{Seated Leg Curl}] are interchangeable. [{Chest Fly}] can be replaced with [{Cable Crossover}] or [{Pec Deck}]. [{Standing Calf Raise}] and [{Seated Calf Raise}] can be swapped for [{Calf Press on Leg Press}].

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Power day main compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}]): 3 sets in the 3-5 rep range. These are heavy — the goal is maximal strength. Keep 1-2 reps in reserve.
- **Power day secondary compounds** ([{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Leg Press}]): 3-4 sets in the 5-10 rep range. Moderate weight, still compound focused.
- **Power day isolation** ([{Bicep Curl, Barbell}], [{Skullcrusher}], [{Lying Leg Curl}], [{Standing Calf Raise}]): 2-4 sets in the 6-10 rep range.
- **Hypertrophy day exercises**: 3 sets in the 8-12 rep range for compounds, 10-15 for isolation. The load should be challenging but allow you to maintain strict form and controlled tempo through all reps.

## Progressive Overload

This implementation uses **double progression** for all exercises: work within your rep range, and when you can hit the top-end reps on all sets, add 5lb and reset to the bottom of the range.

For example, [{Bench Press}] starts at 3x3. Each session you try to add reps: 3x3 → 3x4 → 3x5. Once you complete 3x5, the weight goes up by 5lb and you reset to 3x3 at the new weight.

The same logic applies to hypertrophy exercises: [{Incline Bench Press}] at 3x8 → 3x9 → ... → 3x12, then add 5lb and reset to 3x8.

**When you stall**: If you can't add reps for 2-3 consecutive sessions, reduce the weight by 10% and build back up. This gives your body a chance to recover and often lets you push past the old plateau.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run PHUL for **12-16 weeks** before reassessing. Take a deload week (50% of normal weights, same exercises and reps) at the 6-week mark if fatigue is accumulating, and definitely after 12 weeks.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You're stalling on most lifts despite deloading, sessions feel like a grind, or your goals have shifted toward pure strength or pure hypertrophy. Transition to **PHAT** (5-day version with more volume), a **5/3/1 variant** (for strength focus), or a **PPL split** (for more training frequency if you have 5-6 days available).

## Equipment Needed

The program as written requires a barbell, dumbbells, a cable machine, and a leg press/leg curl/leg extension machine.

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Goblet Squat}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}]
- [{Lying Leg Curl}] / [{Seated Leg Curl}] → [{Romanian Deadlift}] or [{Good Morning}]
- [{Leg Extension}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Lunge}]
- [{Triceps Extension, Cable}] → [{Skullcrusher}] or [{Triceps Dip}]
- [{Calf Press on Leg Press}] → [{Standing Calf Raise}]

## Rest Times

- **Power day main compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Overhead Press}]): **2 minutes** between sets. Up to 3-5 minutes if needed for top sets.
- **Power day accessories**: **90 seconds**
- **Hypertrophy day compounds** ([{Incline Bench Press}], [{Front Squat}]): **90 seconds**
- **Hypertrophy day isolation**: **60 seconds**

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**If you know your 1RM**: Use about 80-85% for power day main lifts (3-5 reps) and 60-70% for hypertrophy day exercises (8-12 reps).

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Start conservatively. Pick a weight where you can comfortably complete all prescribed sets with 2-3 reps in reserve. It's better to start too light and progress steadily than to start too heavy and stall immediately. The double progression will bring you up to the right working weights within 2-3 weeks.

**Common mistake**: Starting too heavy on [{Deadlift}] and [{Squat}] on the same day. Remember that [{Deadlift}] comes after [{Squat}] on Lower Power — you'll be fatigued. Start [{Deadlift}] lighter than you think you need to.

## Common Modifications

- **Add abs**: Tack on 2-3 sets of [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Cable Crunch}] at the end of lower body days, or train abs on rest days.
- **Add rear delts**: [{Face Pull}] or [{Reverse Fly}] at the end of upper body days — the program is light on rear delt work.
- **Swap deadlift day**: Some lifters move [{Deadlift}] to its own day or swap it to the hypertrophy lower day as [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] to reduce fatigue on Lower Power.
- **3-day variant**: Run Upper Power / Lower Power / Full Body Hypertrophy if you only have 3 training days.
- **Bump to 4 sets**: Once you adapt to 3 sets (after 3-4 weeks), add a 4th set to the main compound exercises for more volume.
