Jon Andersen's Deep Water Method is a 6-week high-volume block built around 10 sets of 10 reps on compound lifts. The weight stays constant throughout — progression comes entirely from reducing rest periods every two weeks (4 min → 3 min → 2 min). Designed by an IFBB Pro bodybuilder and former strongman to build mental toughness, work capacity, and significant muscle mass.

## Origin & Philosophy

Deep Water was created by [Jon Andersen](https://www.jon-andersen.com/free-deep-water-ebook/), an IFBB Pro bodybuilder who competed at approximately 300 lbs at ~8% body fat, and was also a professional wrestler and strongman competitor. The program is documented in his book *Deep Water: Overcoming the Waves of Life*.

The core philosophy centers on mental toughness and pushing past perceived physical limits. Andersen describes "portals" — breakthrough moments during extended sets where the lifter realizes they can push further than they thought possible. The name "Deep Water" is a metaphor for being thrown into an extremely challenging situation with no way out but through. The program is not primarily about increasing your 1RM — it's about building your ability to perform enormous amounts of work under progressively harsher conditions.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (1+ years of consistent barbell training). The program is called "beginner" because it's the entry point to Andersen's system, not because it's for gym beginners.
- **Prerequisites**: Solid technique on [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Push Press, Barbell}]. You need to know (or estimate) your 1RM for these lifts. Comfortable performing extended high-rep sets.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy and work capacity.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or aggressive maintenance. Andersen prescribes 2g protein per pound of bodyweight and generous caloric intake. Running this on a cut is not recommended.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- 10x10 compounds force massive training volume (100 reps per main lift) — one of the most effective short-term hypertrophy protocols available
- Simple and elegant progression: same weight, shorter rest — no spreadsheets or percentage calculations needed
- Only 4 lifting days per week, leaving room for recovery and conditioning
- Alternating [{Squat}]/[{Deadlift}] and [{Push Press, Barbell}]/[{Overhead Press}] each week prevents accumulated fatigue on any single lift while still training both patterns frequently
- Finite 6-week duration provides a clear endpoint — you can push harder knowing it's temporary
- Builds extraordinary mental toughness and cardiovascular conditioning from the extended high-rep sets

**Cons**

- Sessions run 90-120+ minutes — the 10x10 main lift alone takes 45-60 minutes in weeks 1-2 with 4-minute rests
- No lower body accessories beyond [{Lunge}]s — relies entirely on [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] volume for leg development
- Recovery demands are extreme — requires significant caloric intake, quality sleep, and no additional high-intensity training
- The 10x10 sets at 2-minute rest (weeks 5-6) are as much a cardio challenge as a strength challenge — lifters with poor conditioning will struggle
- Not suitable for cutting or caloric deficit

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Two "Deep Water" days (10x10 compounds) and two bodybuilding days (back and chest), totaling 4 sessions per week
- **Periodization**: Fixed weight with progressive rest reduction — 4 minutes between 10x10 sets in weeks 1-2, 3 minutes in weeks 3-4, 2 minutes in weeks 5-6
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — Day 1 (Deep Water Lower), Day 2 (Back), Day 3 (Deep Water Upper), Day 4 (Chest)
- **Exercise rotation**: [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] alternate each week on Day 1. [{Push Press, Barbell}] and [{Overhead Press}] alternate each week on Day 3. Odd weeks are Squat + Push Press; even weeks are Deadlift + Strict Press.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Deep Water Day 1 (Lower)** pairs light technique work on the opposite movement (3x10 at ~40% 1RM) with the main 10x10 lift. On squat weeks, you do light deadlifts first; on deadlift weeks, light squats. [{Lunge}]s follow the main lift to finish off the legs.

**Day 2 (Back)** builds the posterior chain and pulling strength needed to support the heavy compound days. [{Bent Over Row}] (weeks 1-4) develops horizontal pull strength, then swaps to [{Shrug, Barbell}] (weeks 5-6) for trap development. [{Clean}] technique work (3x10 light) prepares you for the Intermediate phase, which introduces 10x10 power cleans. [{Lateral Raise}]s and [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}]s add direct arm and shoulder work.

**Deep Water Day 3 (Upper)** is the 10x10 pressing day. [{Push Press, Barbell}] allows more total weight moved through leg drive, while [{Overhead Press}] (strict press) builds raw shoulder strength. [{Lateral Raise}]s and [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}]s round out the session.

**Day 4 (Chest)** covers pressing from three angles: [{Bench Press}] for raw strength, [{Bench Press Close Grip}] for tricep development, and [{Incline Bench Press}] for upper chest. [{Chest Dip}]s add high-rep bodyweight pressing volume.

**Core work** ([{Sit Up}] + [{Back Extension, Bodyweight}]) appears on every lifting day — spinal erector and abdominal endurance are critical for supporting the heavy compound volume.

## Set & Rep Scheme

Main 10x10 lifts use 70% of your estimated 10RM, which equals approximately **54% of 1RM**. This weight feels moderate on set 1 and becomes brutally difficult by sets 8-10, especially as rest periods shrink across the program.

Light technique work uses approximately **40% of 1RM** for 3x10 — enough to groove the movement pattern without creating fatigue before the main 10x10 work.

Accessories use standard bodybuilding rep ranges: 3-5 sets of 10 reps. [{Pull Up}]s and [{Chest Dip}]s are performed as AMRAP (as many reps as possible) since they're bodyweight movements.

Core work is 3 sets of 20 reps each for [{Sit Up}]s and [{Back Extension, Bodyweight}]s — performed as a superset with minimal rest between exercises.

## Progressive Overload

The main 10x10 lifts **do not increase in weight** during the 6-week beginner phase. Progression is entirely through rest period reduction:

- **Weeks 1-2**: 4 minutes between 10x10 sets
- **Weeks 3-4**: 3 minutes between 10x10 sets
- **Weeks 5-6**: 2 minutes between 10x10 sets

This forces your body to perform the same total volume under increasingly demanding conditions. By weeks 5-6, the same weight that felt manageable in week 1 becomes a war of attrition.

Accessories use double progression — reps increase within a range (8-12), and once you hit the top of the range, weight goes up and reps reset. This provides a sustainable rate of overload for intermediate+ lifters. Bodyweight exercises (pull-ups, dips, core) are performed as AMRAP sets and progress naturally as you get stronger.

There is no deload built into the program. The active recovery day (light conditioning) is the only programmed lighter work.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the beginner phase for exactly 6 weeks. After completing it, take a light week, then consider:

- **Deep Water Intermediate** (6 more weeks): increases weight to 80% of 10RM, reduces total sets from 10 to 9 then 8 to hit 100 reps, and adds 10x10 power cleans as a third Deep Water day
- [5/3/1: Building the Monolith](/programs/monolith531): another high-volume block with periodized main lift work and extreme accessory volume
- [Bullmastiff](/programs/bullmastiff): a structured 18-week strength program with wave periodization if you want to convert your new work capacity into maximal strength

Signs the program has served its purpose: you can complete all 10x10 sets at 2-minute rest without failing, your work capacity has noticeably improved, and you've gained visible size.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates
- Squat rack or power rack
- Flat bench and incline bench
- Dumbbells (for lateral raises)
- Pull-up bar
- Dip station

**Home gym substitutions:**

- [{Incline Bench Press}] → floor press or deficit push-ups
- [{Clean}] → [{Deadlift High Pull}] or additional rowing
- [{Chest Dip}] → close-grip push-ups or bench dips
- [{Lateral Raise}] → plates or resistance bands

## Rest Times

- **10x10 main lifts**: 4 minutes (weeks 1-2) → 3 minutes (weeks 3-4) → 2 minutes (weeks 5-6)
- **Light technique work**: 90-120 seconds
- **Accessories**: 60-120 seconds
- **Core work**: minimal rest between sit-ups and back extensions, 60 seconds between rounds

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Set your 1RM in the app for [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Push Press, Barbell}]. The program automatically calculates the 10x10 working weight at 54% of 1RM (≈ 70% of your estimated 10RM).

If you don't know your 1RM, use the app's built-in RM calculator — test a heavy set of 3-5 reps and let it estimate your max.

**Common mistake**: starting too heavy. The weight should feel easy on set 1. It won't feel easy by set 7. If in doubt, round down.

## Common Modifications

- Replace [{Push Press, Barbell}] with [{Overhead Press}] on all weeks if you prefer strict pressing exclusively
- Add [{Face Pull}]s or band pull-aparts between pressing sets for shoulder health
- Replace [{Bent Over Row}] with [{Pendlay Row}] for stricter form
- Replace [{Lunge}] with [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] for more single-leg focus
- Add 20 minutes of low-intensity conditioning on a 5th day (as Andersen prescribes) — stairs, incline walking, or swimming
- Replace [{Sit Up}] with [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Plank}] if you have lower back concerns

### Is the Deep Water Method good for beginners?

Deep Water is labeled "beginner" because it's the entry point to Jon Andersen's 18-week system, not because it's for gym beginners. You should have at least 1 year of consistent barbell training and solid technique on Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, and Overhead Press before attempting this program.

### How long does a Deep Water workout take?

Expect 90-120+ minutes per session. The 10x10 main lift alone takes 45-60 minutes in weeks 1-2 (with 4-minute rest periods). This shrinks to 30-40 minutes by weeks 5-6 as rest periods drop to 2 minutes. Add warmup, accessories, and core work on top.

### Why doesn't the weight increase during the Deep Water program?

Progression comes from reducing rest periods, not adding weight. Performing 100 reps with 2 minutes rest (weeks 5-6) is dramatically harder than the same 100 reps with 4 minutes rest (weeks 1-2). This builds work capacity and muscular endurance that traditional weight progression alone cannot achieve.

### Can I run Deep Water on a cut?

Not recommended. The extreme volume demands significant caloric intake for recovery. Jon Andersen prescribes 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight and generous fat intake. Running this in a deficit will likely result in excessive fatigue, poor recovery, and incomplete workouts.

### What if I can't finish all 10 sets of 10 reps?

Push through as many sets as you can. If you truly cannot complete a set, rest longer than prescribed and continue. The goal is to complete all 100 reps. If you consistently fail before set 8, reduce the starting weight by 5-10%.

### What should I do after completing the Deep Water Beginner program?

The natural next step is Deep Water Intermediate (6 weeks), which increases the weight and reduces the number of sets to still achieve 100 total reps. Alternatively, transition to a strength-focused program like Building the Monolith or Bullmastiff to convert your new work capacity into maximal strength gains.

### How do I calculate my starting weight for the 10x10 sets?

Set your 1RM in the app, and the program automatically calculates the working weight at 54% of 1RM. This approximates 70% of your estimated 10-rep max. If you don't know your 1RM, test a heavy set of 3-5 reps and use the app's built-in RM calculator to estimate it.

### Can I skip the power clean technique work?

Yes. The Clean technique work in the Beginner phase is specifically preparation for the Intermediate phase, which includes 10x10 power cleans. If cleans aren't in your plans, substitute with Deadlift High Pulls or additional Bent Over Rows.
