A beginner barbell program and the classic phase of Starting Strength. [{Power Clean}] replaces [{Deadlift}] on alternate sessions, reducing deadlift frequency to aid recovery while maintaining posterior chain development through explosive pulling. This is the phase most beginner lifters spend the longest in — typically several months of consistent 5lb jumps.

## Origin & Philosophy

Starting Strength was created by **Mark Rippetoe**, a competitive powerlifter and strength coach based in Wichita Falls, Texas. The program is detailed in his book *Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training*, first published in 2005 and now in its [3rd edition (2011)](https://aasgaardco.com/store/books-702/starting-strength-basic-barbell-training-3rd-edition/). The companion book *Practical Programming for Strength Training* covers the programming theory behind the novice progression.

The core philosophy: beginners can add weight to the bar every single session for months — the "Novice Effect." Rather than waste this window on machines or complicated periodization, Starting Strength exploits it with a handful of barbell movements, linear loading, and full recovery between sessions. Strength is treated as the most fundamental physical adaptation — muscle size, power, and endurance all improve as side effects of getting stronger.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Beginners who have completed Phase 1 (1–3 weeks of training), or any novice whose deadlift is heavy enough that doing it every session impairs recovery
- **Goal**: Continue building foundational barbell strength with sustainable deadlift frequency
- **Prerequisites**: Comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Deadlift}] form. Willing to learn the [{Power Clean}] (or substitute [{Bent Over Row}])
- **Diet**: Best run on a caloric surplus — you need to eat to fuel recovery and growth. Works on maintenance calories but expect earlier stalls

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Fastest possible strength gains for a beginner — linear weight increases every session can add 50–100lb to [{Squat}] in 2–3 months
- Only 3 exercises per session — sessions take 45–60 minutes
- Squatting 3x/week builds movement proficiency fast
- [{Power Clean}] develops explosiveness and posterior chain power that most beginner programs skip entirely
- Extremely well-documented — the book has 300+ pages of detailed technique instruction for every lift

**Cons**

- No direct arm, upper back, or ab work — your arms and abs grow only indirectly from the main lifts
- [{Power Clean}] is technically demanding and hard to learn without a coach — many beginners substitute [{Bent Over Row}] instead
- Only 1 set of [{Deadlift}] per session, and only every other session — some lifters want more pulling volume
- [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] are each only trained 3 times every 2 weeks — low frequency for upper body
- The "eat big" dietary advice can lead to excessive fat gain if taken too literally

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, A/B alternating
- **Periodization**: Straight linear progression — add weight every session
- **Rotation**: Week 1 = A/B/A, Week 2 = B/A/B, repeat
- Train 3 days per week on non-consecutive days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)

Workout A has [{Deadlift}]; Workout B has [{Power Clean}]. [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] alternate between the two workouts.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Every session starts with [{Squat}] because it trains the most muscle mass and benefits most from high frequency. Squatting 3x/week maximizes the technique practice that drives rapid novice gains.

The second exercise alternates between [{Bench Press}] (horizontal push) and [{Overhead Press}] (vertical push). Together they build complete upper body pressing strength. Alternating gives each lift recovery time.

The third exercise is a pull: [{Deadlift}] in Workout A and [{Power Clean}] in Workout B. By Phase 2, deadlift weights are heavy enough that pulling heavy 3x/week impairs recovery — particularly for the next session's squats. Power cleans train explosive hip extension with lighter loads, continuing to develop the posterior chain without the same recovery cost. The explosive nature of cleans also helps drive deadlift strength up indirectly.

**Substitutions**: If you can't do power cleans (no coaching available, no platform, etc.), [{Bent Over Row}] is the most common replacement. Rows build upper back and posterior chain strength, though you lose the explosive training component. Rippetoe himself allows this substitution.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}]: **3x5** — heavy enough to drive neural adaptation, enough volume to practice the movement. The classic strength-building rep range.
- [{Deadlift}]: **1x5** — deadlifts are the most systemically fatiguing lift. One heavy set of 5 is sufficient stimulus for a novice while preserving recovery for the next session's squats.
- [{Power Clean}]: **5x3** — cleans are performed in triples because power production degrades with fatigue. More sets at low reps lets you practice the explosive movement with quality technique on every rep.

All sets are straight work sets at the same weight. No AMRAP sets, no back-off sets. Hit your reps, add weight next time.

## Progressive Overload

**Weight increases per session:**

| Lift | Increase |
|------|----------|
| [{Squat}] | +5lb |
| [{Deadlift}] | +5lb |
| [{Bench Press}] | +5lb |
| [{Overhead Press}] | +5lb |
| [{Power Clean}] | +5lb |

When 5lb jumps become too much for upper body lifts (typically after several weeks), switch to **2.5lb jumps** using microplates (1.25lb per side). This extends linear progression significantly on [{Overhead Press}] and [{Bench Press}].

**When you stall** (can't complete all prescribed reps for 2 consecutive workouts on the same lift):

1. **Deload 10%** from your current working weight on that lift
2. Work back up using normal session-to-session increases
3. After 2–3 deloads with no sustained progress on a lift, that lift may need intermediate programming

Each lift is tracked independently. Stalling on [{Overhead Press}] doesn't affect [{Squat}] progression.

**Before deloading**, check your recovery: are you sleeping 7–9 hours? Eating enough protein (0.7–1g per lb bodyweight) and total calories? Poor recovery is the #1 cause of premature stalls.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Run Phase 2 for several weeks to several months.** This is the longest phase of the novice program — most beginner lifters spend 2–4 months here.

**Move to Phase 3 when**: Upper body lifts start stalling despite microloading, and you want to add [{Chin Up}] for more pulling volume. Or transition directly to an intermediate program if you've exhausted linear progression on most lifts (typically after 2–3 deload cycles with no sustained progress).

**Good next steps**:
- **Starting Strength Phase 3** — adds [{Chin Up}], alternates [{Deadlift}]/[{Power Clean}] on A days
- **Texas Method** — the natural intermediate continuation; weekly periodization with volume/recovery/intensity days
- **Madcow 5x5** — weekly progression with ramping sets
- **5/3/1** — monthly periodization, very flexible, runs indefinitely

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates
- Squat rack or power rack
- Flat bench
- **Microplates** (1.25lb each) for 2.5lb total jumps — most gyms don't stock these, buy your own

If doing [{Power Clean}], bumper plates and a platform are ideal but not strictly required. If substituting with [{Bent Over Row}], no additional equipment needed.

## Rest Times

- **Warmup sets**: Just long enough to change plates (30–60 seconds)
- **Early work sets**: 2–3 minutes
- **Heavy work sets**: 3–5 minutes (up to 7 minutes near max effort on [{Squat}]/[{Deadlift}])

Rest as long as needed to complete the next set. Rushing rest is the #1 reason novices fail sets they should make.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

If transitioning from Phase 1, continue with your current weights — just start [{Power Clean}] fresh.

For [{Power Clean}] specifically: start with an empty bar and add weight in 10lb increments until bar speed slows. Typical starting point is 65–95lb. Focus on learning the movement before chasing weight.

If starting the program fresh (skipping Phase 1), use this method for each exercise:

1. Start with the empty bar (45lb) for a set of 5
2. Add 10–20lb, do another set of 5
3. Repeat until bar speed noticeably slows
4. Use that weight as your first working weight

**Start lighter than you think.** You have months of 5lb jumps ahead — starting light and building momentum is far better than starting heavy and stalling early.

## Common Modifications

- **Replace [{Power Clean}] with [{Bent Over Row}]**: The most popular modification. Rows build upper back strength but don't train explosive power. Recommended for beginners training without a coach.
- **Add [{Chin Up}] early**: Rippetoe adds chin-ups in Phase 3, but many lifters add 3 sets to failure at the end of Workout B sooner for upper back and bicep work.
- **Add [{Back Extension, Bodyweight}]**: 3x10 at the end of sessions for lower back endurance.
- **Microloading**: When 5lb jumps become too much for [{Overhead Press}] and [{Bench Press}], switch to 2.5lb jumps using fractional plates (1.25lb each side).
- **No power clean variant**: Replace [{Power Clean}] with [{Deadlift}] 1x5 on Workout B, making deadlift every session. Only viable if your deadlift is still light enough to recover from — otherwise you'll regress to Phase 1's recovery problems.
