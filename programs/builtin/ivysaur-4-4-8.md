A popular Reddit beginner program designed to fix the weaknesses of Starting Strength and StrongLifts 5x5. Three days per week across a 2-week rotating cycle, alternating between heavy sets of 4 and lighter sets of 8 for every lift. AMRAP sets every other week determine progression speed — hit 8+ reps and you double the weight increase.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Ivysaur 4-4-8 program was created by Reddit user [/u/lvysaur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4uijsl/a_detailed_look_at_why_stronglifts_starting/) and posted to r/Fitness in 2016. The post was a detailed critique of Starting Strength and StrongLifts 5x5, arguing that both programs have structural flaws: too much squatting relative to other lifts, not enough bench press or deadlift volume, no rep variation, and no built-in mechanism to adjust progression speed.

The 4-4-8 name refers to the rep scheme: exercises alternate between sets of 4 (heavier, strength-focused) and sets of 8 (lighter, hypertrophy-focused). This undulating approach gives beginners exposure to both heavy and moderate loads, building strength and muscle simultaneously rather than relying on a single rep range.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Complete beginners or lifters returning after a long layoff
- **Goal**: Build strength in all major barbell lifts while getting more bench press and deadlift volume than typical beginner programs
- **Works on any diet**: Beginners gain strength on a caloric deficit, though a slight surplus will accelerate progress

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- [{Bench Press}] trained every session (3x/week) — more pressing volume than Starting Strength or StrongLifts
- [{Deadlift}] trained 2-3x per 2-week cycle instead of once — addresses the biggest gap in StrongLifts
- AMRAP sets auto-regulate progression: if you're advancing fast, the program doubles your weight jumps; if you're struggling, you progress at the base rate
- Alternating 4-rep and 8-rep days develop both strength and muscle, not just one
- [{Chin Up}] included for direct bicep work, which Starting Strength and StrongLifts both lack

**Cons**

- No isolation accessories — if you want direct arm, lateral delt, or ab work, you'll need to add your own
- Aggressive progression rates (up to +30lb/cycle on squat) mean beginners may stall within 6-8 weeks
- The 2-week rotating cycle is slightly harder to track than a simple A/B alternation
- [{Squat}] frequency is lower (2x per 2-week cycle) than in Starting Strength/StrongLifts (3x/week), which means less squat technique practice

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, 2-week rotating cycle
- **Periodization**: Weekly undulating — each exercise alternates between heavy (4-rep) and light (8-rep) sessions
- **Rotation**: Week 1 = Day 1/Day 2/Day 3, Week 2 = Day 4/Day 5/Day 6, then repeat
- The 8-rep weight is 90% of the 4-rep weight for each exercise

**Week A**

| | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| [{Bench Press}] | 4x4 | 4x8 | 3x4 + 1xAMRAP |
| [{Squat}] | 4x8 | — | 3x4 + 1xAMRAP |
| [{Deadlift}] | — | 4x4 | — |
| [{Overhead Press}] | 4x8 | 4x4 | 4x8 |
| [{Chin Up}] | 4x8 | — | 4x4 |
| [{Bent Over Row}] | — | 4x8 | — |

**Week B**

| | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| [{Bench Press}] | 4x8 | 4x4 | 4x8 |
| [{Squat}] | — | 4x8 | — |
| [{Deadlift}] | 4x8 | — | 3x4 + 1xAMRAP |
| [{Overhead Press}] | 4x4 | 4x8 | 3x4 + 1xAMRAP |
| [{Chin Up}] | — | 4x8 | — |
| [{Bent Over Row}] | 4x4 | — | 4x8 |

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Every session has 4 exercises: one horizontal press, one lower body compound, one overhead press variation, and one upper back pull.

[{Bench Press}] appears every session because the original author argued that StrongLifts and Starting Strength under-train the bench relative to other lifts. [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] rotate across sessions — when squat appears, [{Chin Up}] is the pull exercise; when deadlift appears, [{Bent Over Row}] is the pull. [{Overhead Press}] appears every session at the opposite rep scheme from bench (when bench is heavy, OHP is light, and vice versa).

**Substitutions**: Replace [{Chin Up}] with [{Lat Pulldown}] or band-assisted chin-ups if you can't do bodyweight reps. [{Bent Over Row}] can be swapped for [{Pendlay Row}]. No substitutions recommended for the main three lifts — learning [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Deadlift}] is the point.

## Set & Rep Scheme

Every exercise uses either **4 sets of 4 reps** (heavy day, ~80% of 1RM) or **4 sets of 8 reps** (light day, ~72% of 1RM). The 8-rep weight is approximately 90% of the 4-rep weight.

On Day 3 of each week, two exercises swap their last set for an **AMRAP set** (as many reps as possible): 3 sets of 4 + 1 AMRAP set. In Week 1, [{Bench Press}] and [{Squat}] get the AMRAP test. In Week 2, [{Overhead Press}] and [{Deadlift}] get it. This means every main lift gets tested once per 2-week cycle.

The alternation between 4-rep and 8-rep days serves a dual purpose: 4-rep sets build maximal strength (heavy loads, low reps), while 8-rep sets accumulate hypertrophy volume (moderate loads, more time under tension).

## Progressive Overload

Weight increases are based on the AMRAP set performance each 2-week cycle:

| Lift | Base increase per cycle | If AMRAP ≥ 8 reps |
|------|----------------------|------------------|
| [{Squat}] / [{Deadlift}] | +15lb | +30lb |
| [{Bench Press}] / [{Bent Over Row}] | +10lb | +20lb |
| [{Overhead Press}] | +5lb | +10lb |

The AMRAP serves as an auto-regulation mechanism: if you're advancing quickly and crush 8+ reps on the AMRAP, you get double progression. If you barely make the minimum, you progress at the standard rate.

**On failure** (can't complete all prescribed sets and reps): reduce weight by 10% and rebuild. Each exercise is tracked independently.

[{Chin Up}] progresses independently via linear progression — add 2.5lb of added weight after every two successful sessions.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Run for 3-4 months.** The aggressive progression rates mean you'll eventually stall on most lifts. Signs it's time to move on: you're deloading frequently on 2+ lifts, your AMRAP sets barely hit 4, or you've been running it for 12+ weeks.

**Good next programs**:
- [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) — adds tiered exercise structure with more volume and a built-in stall protocol
- [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b) — slower, periodized progression that sustains progress longer
- [Phrak's Greyskull LP](/programs/phrakgreyskull) — another beginner program if you want to stay in the LP phase but want a different structure

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, weight plates, squat rack, flat bench
- Pull-up bar or lat pulldown machine for [{Chin Up}]

**Home gym substitutions**: Replace [{Bent Over Row}] with [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] if you only have dumbbells. Replace [{Chin Up}] with [{Inverted Row}] if you don't have a pull-up bar.

## Rest Times

- **Compound lifts on 4-rep days**: 2-3 minutes between sets
- **Compound lifts on 8-rep days**: 90 seconds to 2 minutes
- **AMRAP sets**: Rest 3 minutes before the AMRAP set to maximize performance
- [{Chin Up}] and [{Bent Over Row}]: 90 seconds

## How to Pick Starting Weights

The program uses 1RM percentages (80% for 4-rep days, 72% for 8-rep days). To set your 1RM in the app:

1. If you know your 1RM for each lift, enter it directly
2. If you don't, use the built-in 1RM calculator: find a weight you can lift for 5 clean reps, and the app will estimate your 1RM
3. If you're completely new, start with just the bar (45lb) for upper body lifts and 95lb for [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}], then adjust based on feel

**Start lighter than you think.** The progression rates are aggressive — you'll reach challenging weights within 3-4 weeks. Starting too heavy leads to early stalls and poor form.

## Common Modifications

- **Add accessories**: After the main 4 lifts, add 2-3 sets of isolation work. Good picks: [{Face Pull}] for rear delts, [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] for arms, [{Hanging Leg Raise}] for abs
- **Can't do chin-ups**: Use [{Lat Pulldown}] at 4x8-12 until you can do bodyweight reps
- **Want more squat volume**: Add 2 extra sets of [{Squat}] on deadlift days at the 8-rep weight
- **5 sets instead of 4**: The original author noted you can do 5 sets if time permits for additional volume

<!-- faq -->

### Is Ivysaur 4-4-8 better than Starting Strength or StrongLifts?

It addresses specific criticisms of those programs: more bench press volume, more deadlift work, rep variation, and auto-regulated progression via AMRAP sets. Whether it's "better" depends on your priorities — if you want more squat frequency, Starting Strength is the better choice. If you want balanced pressing and pulling, Ivysaur has the edge.

### How many days a week is the Ivysaur 4-4-8 program?

It's a 3-day-per-week program with at least one rest day between sessions. A typical schedule is Monday/Wednesday/Friday. The program rotates through a 2-week cycle, so each week has a slightly different combination of exercises and rep schemes.

### What does the AMRAP set mean in Ivysaur 4-4-8?

AMRAP stands for "as many reps as possible." On the third training day of each week, two exercises replace their last set with an AMRAP set. You do at least 4 reps, then keep going with good form. If you hit 8 or more reps, you double your weight increase for the next cycle.

### How long should I run the Ivysaur 4-4-8 program?

Run it for 3-4 months maximum. The aggressive linear progression (up to +15lb per cycle on lower body lifts) means you'll eventually stall. When you're deloading frequently on multiple lifts, transition to an intermediate program like GZCLP or 5/3/1 for Beginners.

### Can I add accessories to the Ivysaur 4-4-8 program?

Yes. The base program has no isolation work. After the main 4 lifts, add 2-3 sets each of exercises like face pulls, bicep curls, and hanging leg raises. Keep accessories light (10-15 reps) and don't let them interfere with recovery for the main lifts.

### What if I can't do chin-ups on the Ivysaur 4-4-8 program?

Replace chin-ups with lat pulldowns at 4 sets of 8-12 reps, or use resistance band-assisted chin-ups. Work on these until you can perform bodyweight chin-ups for all prescribed sets, then switch to the programmed exercise.

### What do I do when I stall on the Ivysaur 4-4-8 program?

When you fail to complete all prescribed reps on a lift, the weight automatically reduces by 10%. Use the lighter weight to rebuild and hit higher AMRAP numbers. Each lift is tracked independently, so stalling on bench doesn't affect your squat progression.

### Why does Ivysaur 4-4-8 have less squatting than Starting Strength?

The original author argued that Starting Strength and StrongLifts over-emphasize squatting (3x/week) at the expense of other lifts, particularly the deadlift and bench press. Ivysaur 4-4-8 redistributes that volume: squats appear 2x per 2-week cycle, while bench press appears every session and deadlifts get 2-3 sessions per cycle.
