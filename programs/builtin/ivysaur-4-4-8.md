A 3-day beginner program created by Reddit user /u/ivysaur to address perceived weaknesses in Starting Strength and StrongLifts. Alternates 4x4 and 4x8 rep schemes across a two-week cycle, with AMRAP sets driving progression. Emphasizes bench press and deadlift frequency while reducing squat volume compared to traditional 5x5 programs.

## Origin & Philosophy

Ivysaur 4-4-8 was created by Reddit user /u/ivysaur in 2016 as a response to the limitations of popular "sets of 5" novice programs like Starting Strength and StrongLifts 5x5. The program was [shared on r/Fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4uijsl/a_detailed_look_at_why_stronglifts_starting/) along with a detailed critique of why those programs undersell upper body and deadlift development.

The core philosophy: beginners can handle more upper body volume than StrongLifts provides, deadlifts shouldn't be relegated to once per week, and AMRAP sets provide better feedback for progression than rigid linear jumps. The "4-4-8" refers to the alternating rep schemes: main lifts rotate between 4x4 (strength) and 4x8 (hypertrophy) across a two-week undulating cycle.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Beginners with 0-3 months of training experience
- **Prerequisites**: Ability to perform the basic barbell lifts with acceptable form
- **Goal**: Build strength and muscle simultaneously through an undulating approach
- **Works on any diet**: Beginners can make progress on maintenance, cut, or bulk

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Bench press 3 times per week builds upper body strength faster than programs that only bench 1.5x per week
- Deadlift appears every week at varying rep ranges, giving twice the frequency of StrongLifts
- AMRAP sets on main lifts provide automatic progression feedback and prevent premature stalling
- Undulating periodization (4x4 one week, 4x8 the next) trains both strength and hypertrophy adaptations
- Direct bicep work via [{Chin Up}] addresses the "T-rex arms" problem of squat-heavy programs
- Reduced squat frequency (1-2x per week) allows better recovery while still building lower body strength

**Cons**

- No programmed direct ab or lower back accessories beyond the compounds
- [{Bent Over Row}] only appears once per week, which may undersell back thickness development
- Sessions can take 60+ minutes due to 16 working sets plus warmups
- Requires microplates (1.25lb) for upper body progression, which most commercial gyms don't have
- No explicit deload protocol beyond dropping weight after failures

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body with rotating main lift emphasis
- **Periodization**: Weekly undulating periodization (WUP) — rep schemes alternate every week
- **Cycle length**: 2 weeks, then repeat
- **Schedule**: Fixed 3 days per week (e.g., Monday/Wednesday/Friday)

**Week A** emphasizes squat (4x8 on Day 1, 4+ AMRAP on Day 3) while deadlift is trained at lower volume.

**Week B** flips the script: deadlift gets higher frequency (4x8 on Day 1, 4+ AMRAP on Day 3) while squat appears only once.

Bench press appears all 3 days every week at varying rep schemes, ensuring high upper body frequency.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Main Lifts** ([{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}]): These are the four primary strength movements. They appear at varying rep ranges across the cycle to develop both strength (4x4) and hypertrophy (4x8).

**Back Work** ([{Bent Over Row}], [{Chin Up}]): Rows provide horizontal pulling to balance the bench press. Chin-ups train the lats and biceps while providing a vertical pull pattern that complements the [{Overhead Press}]. Chin-ups (supinated grip) are specified over pull-ups for direct bicep stimulation.

**Exercise Swaps**:
- If you can't do bodyweight [{Chin Up}], use band-assisted chin-ups or [{Lat Pulldown}]
- [{Bent Over Row}] can be swapped for [{Pendlay Row}] or [{Seal Row}] to reduce lower back fatigue
- Overhead Press can be done seated if shoulder mobility is limited, though standing is preferred

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Main Lifts**: Alternate between 4x4 (strength) and 4x8 (hypertrophy) across the two-week cycle. Some sessions use 3x4, 1x4+ where the final set is AMRAP.

**Why these rep ranges**: 4 reps sits in the strength zone while still providing enough volume per set. 8 reps targets hypertrophy while keeping intensity high enough to carry over to strength. This creates a balance between strength and size development.

**AMRAP Sets**: On Day 3 of each week, [{Bench Press}] and one lower body lift (squat or deadlift depending on the week) end with an AMRAP set. This final set determines next week's progression rate. If you hit 8+ reps on a 4+ AMRAP set, you double the weight increase.

## Progressive Overload

**Standard Progression** (after successful AMRAP with fewer than 8 reps):

| Exercise | Weekly Increase |
|----------|----------------|
| [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}] | +15lb |
| [{Bench Press}], [{Bent Over Row}] | +10lb |
| [{Overhead Press}] | +5lb |

**Accelerated Progression** (if AMRAP set hits 8+ reps): Double the increase for that lift next week.

**Failure Protocol**: If you fail to complete the prescribed reps on any set, keep the same weight next session and try again. If you fail the same weight twice, reduce by 10% and work back up.

**Chin-Ups**: Add a rep to each set when possible. Once you hit 4x8 bodyweight, add weight (5-10lb) and drop back to 4x4, then progress reps again.

Progression applies independently to each lift. Stalling on [{Overhead Press}] doesn't affect your squat.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Recommended Duration**: 3-6 months, until you're stalling on multiple lifts regularly.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You're deloading every 2-3 weeks, AMRAP sets barely exceed the minimum reps, or you want more exercise variety.

**Transition Programs**:
- [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) — similar structure with more volume and accessory customization
- [nSuns](/programs/nsuns) — if you want more volume and don't mind longer sessions
- [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) — if you want to shift to monthly progression with more hypertrophy focus

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell
- Squat rack or power rack
- Bench press setup
- Pull-up bar or assisted chin-up machine
- Weight plates (including 1.25lb microplates if available)

**For Home Gym**: If you don't have a pull-up bar, use resistance bands for band-assisted chin-ups or substitute [{Barbell Curl}] + [{Lat Pulldown}] (if you have a cable setup).

## Rest Times

- **4x4 sets**: 3-4 minutes between sets (strength work needs full recovery)
- **4x8 sets**: 2-3 minutes between sets
- **AMRAP sets**: 4-5 minutes before attempting
- **Between exercises**: 2-3 minutes

These are guidelines. Rest as needed to perform each set with good form.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**Method 1** (if you know your rep maxes): Use weights where 4x4 feels challenging but doable, and 4x8 leaves 2-3 reps in the tank.

**Method 2** (if you're new): Start with the empty bar (45lb) for all lifts, add 10lb per session until the weight feels moderately difficult, then begin the program at that weight.

**Method 3** (conservative estimate):
- [{Squat}]: 95-135lb
- [{Bench Press}]: 65-95lb
- [{Deadlift}]: 115-135lb
- [{Overhead Press}]: 45-65lb
- [{Bent Over Row}]: 65-95lb

**Common Mistake**: Starting too heavy. The program adds 15lb per week to lower body lifts. If you start at 135lb squat, you'll be at 225lb in 6 weeks. Leave room to grow.

## Common Modifications

**4-Day Version**: Split Day 3 exercises across two days for shorter sessions. Day 3a = bench + squat AMRAP. Day 3b = OHP + chin-ups.

**Adding Accessories**: Add 2-3 sets of direct arm work ([{Barbell Curl}], [{Triceps Dips}]) or core work ([{Ab Wheel Rollout}], [{Hanging Leg Raise}]) after main lifts if recovery allows. Keep it minimal — the program already has high volume.

**Exercise Swaps**:
- [{Front Squat}] instead of [{Squat}] if you want more quad emphasis or have lower back fatigue
- [{Incline Bench Press}] for one of the bench sessions if you want more upper chest work
- [{Romanian Deadlift}] instead of [{Deadlift}] on the 4x8 days if conventional deadlifts interfere with squat recovery

**Equipment Substitutions**:
- No pull-up bar: [{Lat Pulldown}] or [{Inverted Row}]
- No barbell: Use dumbbells for all movements except deadlift (substitute [{Trap Bar Deadlift}] or [{Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift}])

### Is Ivysaur 4-4-8 good for beginners?

Yes, it's designed specifically for beginners with less than 3 months of lifting experience. The alternating rep schemes provide exposure to both strength and hypertrophy training, and AMRAP sets prevent you from progressing too fast or too slow.

### How many days per week is Ivysaur 4-4-8?

3 days per week, typically Monday/Wednesday/Friday or similar with at least one rest day between sessions. The program requires full recovery between workouts due to the high frequency of bench press and the rotating squat/deadlift emphasis.

### How long should I run Ivysaur 4-4-8?

Run it for 3-6 months until you're stalling frequently on multiple lifts. As a beginner program, it's designed to get you through your initial strength gains before transitioning to an intermediate program with more volume and exercise variety.

### What's the difference between Ivysaur 4-4-8 and StrongLifts?

Ivysaur 4-4-8 has more upper body volume (bench 3x per week vs 1.5x), more deadlift frequency (every week vs alternating), less squat volume (1-2x per week vs 3x), and uses undulating periodization (alternating 4x4 and 4x8) instead of straight sets of 5. It also includes chin-ups for direct arm work.

### Can I run Ivysaur 4-4-8 on a cut?

Yes, beginners can build strength even in a caloric deficit. You may progress slightly slower than on a bulk, and you might need to deload more frequently, but the program structure works fine for cutting.

### What if I can't do chin-ups?

Use band-assisted chin-ups, the assisted chin-up machine, or substitute [{Lat Pulldown}]. Start with a weight/band assistance that allows you to do 4 sets of 4-8 reps, then progress by reducing assistance over time until you can do bodyweight chin-ups.

### Should I do warmup sets?

Yes, do 2-3 warmup sets before your first working set of each exercise. For example: 1x5 empty bar, 1x3 at 50%, 1x1 at 75%, then start working sets. Subsequent exercises in the same movement pattern (like going from bench to OHP) need less warmup.

### What happens if I fail a set on Ivysaur 4-4-8?

Keep the same weight next session and try again. If you fail the same weight twice, reduce by 10% and work back up. Don't reduce weight after a single failed session — fatigue and off-days are normal.
