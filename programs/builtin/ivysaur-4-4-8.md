A Reddit-born beginner strength program that addresses the shortcomings of Starting Strength and StrongLifts by adding more upper body volume, benching three times per week, and using AMRAP-based progression. Two-week alternating cycle with 4x4 and 4x8 rep schemes plus accelerated progression for strong AMRAP performances.

## Origin & Philosophy

Created by Reddit user /u/ivysaur and posted to [r/Fitness in 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4uijsl/a_detailed_look_at_why_stronglifts_starting/), the Ivysaur 4-4-8 program was designed to fix the main complaints about traditional "sets of 5" novice programs like Starting Strength and StrongLifts 5x5.

The core philosophy: beginners need more upper body volume and frequency than lower body work. While squatting 3x/week makes sense early on, benching only 1.5x/week and deadlifting once per week leaves gains on the table. Ivysaur flips this — you bench 3x/week, squat and deadlift get more balanced frequency, and chin-ups add direct bicep work that traditional novice programs skip entirely.

The name "4-4-8" comes from the rep scheme: sets of 4 reps at higher intensity, and sets of 8 reps at lower intensity (roughly 90% of your 4-rep weight).

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Beginners (0-6 months) or intermediate lifters coming back after a layoff
- **Prerequisites**: Ability to perform the basic barbell lifts with proper form
- **Primary goal**: Building strength on the big 4 (squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press) while adding muscle mass
- **Diet**: Works on bulk, maintenance, or cut — beginners make strength gains regardless

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Benching 3x/week with varied intensities (4×4, 4×8, AMRAP) builds technique and mass faster than 1.5x/week programs
- Deadlift trained 2x/week at different rep ranges improves both technique and recovery capacity
- AMRAP sets determine progression rate — if you crush it, you double the weight jump (accelerated progression)
- Chin-ups included by default, solving the "no direct arm work" problem of SS/SL
- Takes 45-60 minutes per session compared to 90+ minutes for higher-volume programs

**Cons**

- No direct core or ab work — add planks or hanging leg raises if you want them
- Squatting only 1-2x/week is less than SS/SL, which may slow squat progress for some
- Weekly jumps of 10-15lb on lower body lifts require accurate starting weights — too heavy and you'll stall fast
- Bench volume is aggressive for some beginners and may lead to elbow or shoulder issues if recovery is poor
- The 8-rep weight at 90% of 4-rep weight is an estimate — you may need to adjust based on feel

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, 2-week rotating cycle (Week 1 / Week 2)
- **Periodization**: Linear progression with AMRAP-based auto-regulation
- **Days per week**: 3, non-consecutive (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri or Tue/Thu/Sat)

A typical two-week block:

| Week 1 | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| | Bench 4×4 | Bench 4×8 | Bench AMRAP |
| | Squat 4×8 | Deadlift 4×4 | Squat AMRAP |

| Week 2 | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| | Bench 4×8 | Bench 4×4 | Bench 4×8 |
| | Deadlift 4×8 | Squat 4×8 | Deadlift AMRAP |

Each day alternates which exercise gets the heavier (4×4) or lighter (4×8) treatment, and AMRAP sets appear once per week per lift.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Main lifts** (4 total):
- [{Bench Press}] — horizontal push, trained 3x/week to maximize upper body gains
- [{Squat}] — quad-dominant lower, appears 2x in the 2-week cycle at varied intensities
- [{Deadlift}] — hip-dominant lower, 2x per 2-week cycle with alternating rep schemes
- [{Overhead Press}] — vertical push, balanced between 4×4 and 4×8

**Accessories**:
- [{Chin Up}] — vertical pull, trains back and biceps directly (4×4 or 4×8 depending on day)
- [{Bent Over Row}] — horizontal pull, rounds out back development (4×8 or 4×4)

**Why these six exercises**: They cover all major movement patterns (horizontal push/pull, vertical push/pull, quad-dominant squat, hip-dominant hinge). The program prioritizes the big 4 powerlifts but adds rows and chin-ups to prevent muscle imbalances.

**Substitutions**: If you can't do chin-ups yet, use band-assisted chin-ups or lat pulldowns until you can perform bodyweight reps. All other exercises should remain as written — learning these specific movements is the point.

## Set & Rep Scheme

Two intensities alternate throughout the 2-week cycle:

- **4×4**: Four sets of 4 reps at ~85-90% intensity (heavier weight)
- **4×8**: Four sets of 8 reps at ~90% of your 4-rep weight (lighter, more volume)
- **AMRAP**: Final set is "as many reps as possible" — appears once per week per main lift

The 4×8 weight is typically 90% of your 4×4 weight, but adjust based on feel. If 4×8 feels too easy or too hard, tweak the percentage.

AMRAP sets are structured as **3×4 + 1 AMRAP** or **3×8 + 1 AMRAP** — you do 3 straight sets, then push the fourth set for max reps. Stop at RPE 9-9.5 (1 rep left in the tank). Don't grind to failure — save form over ego.

## Progressive Overload

Weight increases happen **weekly** if you complete all prescribed reps:

| Lift | Weekly increase |
|------|-----------------|
| [{Bench Press}] | +10lb |
| [{Bent Over Row}] | +10lb |
| [{Overhead Press}] | +5lb |
| [{Squat}] | +15lb |
| [{Deadlift}] | +15lb |

**Accelerated progression**: If you hit **8+ reps** on any AMRAP set, double the next week's jump for that lift (bench/row +20lb, OHP +10lb, squat/deadlift +30lb).

**Failure/stalling**: If you miss reps on a 4×4 or 4×8 set, keep the weight the same next week. If you stall for 2 consecutive weeks on the same lift, deload 10% and work back up.

**Deload protocol**: Once weights feel consistently heavy (RPE 9.5+ across sets), reduce volume by dropping to 3 sets instead of 4, or reduce 8-rep sets to 5-6 reps and 4-rep sets to 2 reps. This extends program longevity without full deloads.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Recommended duration**: 8-12 weeks, or until you're deloading multiple lifts regularly.

**Signs it's time to move on**:
- Stalling on 2+ lifts despite deloads
- AMRAP sets barely exceed the prescribed reps
- Recovery is lagging — joint pain, constant fatigue, sleep issues
- You want more exercise variety or hypertrophy-focused work

**Good next programs**:
- [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) — tiered structure with more accessory options, still linear progression
- [nSuns 5/3/1 LP](/programs/nsuns) — high-volume 5/3/1 variant with similar frequency
- [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b) — wave-based periodization with built-in accessory templates

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, plates, squat rack, flat bench
- Pull-up bar or lat pulldown machine for chin-ups
- **Microplates** (1.25lb plates) helpful for 5lb jumps on overhead press — buy your own if the gym doesn't stock them

**Home gym alternatives**: Lat pulldown can replace chin-ups if you don't have a pull-up bar (though chin-ups are superior for strength gains).

## Rest Times

- **4×4 sets**: 2-3 minutes between sets
- **4×8 sets**: 90-120 seconds between sets
- **AMRAP sets**: 3-5 minutes before attempting
- **Between exercises**: 2-3 minutes

Prioritize full recovery on heavy 4×4 work. Shorter rests on 4×8 sets are fine since the weight is lighter.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**Method 1: Test day**
For each lift, work up to a comfortable set of 4 reps (leaves 2-3 reps in the tank). Use that as your starting 4×4 weight. Your 4×8 weight is 90% of that.

**Method 2: Conservative estimate**
If you know your estimated 1RM, use these percentages as starting points:
- 4×4 weight: ~75-80% of 1RM
- 4×8 weight: ~67-72% of 1RM (or 90% of your 4×4 weight)

**Critical**: Start lighter than you think. Weekly jumps of 10-15lb add up fast — you'll be at challenging weights within 4-6 weeks. Starting too heavy leads to early stalls and wasted time deloading.

Example starting weights for a 200lb male novice:
- Bench: 95lb (4×4), 85lb (4×8)
- Squat: 135lb (4×4), 120lb (4×8)
- Deadlift: 185lb (4×4), 165lb (4×8)
- Overhead press: 65lb (4×4), 60lb (4×8)
- Bent over row: 95lb (4×4), 85lb (4×8)
- Chin-up: Bodyweight (0lb added)

## Common Modifications

**Can't do chin-ups**: Use band-assisted chin-ups, lat pulldowns (3-4 sets of 8-12), or inverted rows until you build enough strength for bodyweight chin-ups. Progress to chin-ups as soon as possible.

**Add direct arm/shoulder work**: After main lifts, add 2-3 sets each of face pulls, lateral raises, bicep curls, or tricep extensions at 10-15 reps. Keep these light and don't let them interfere with main lift recovery.

**More squat frequency**: If you want to squat more, add a light 3×8 squat set on deadlift days. Don't exceed 70% of your 4×4 weight or it'll hurt deadlift performance.

**More deadlift volume**: Original author recommends keeping deadlifts to 1-2 working sets if they're interfering with squat recovery. Some people do full 4×4 or 4×8, others do 1×4 or 2×4. Experiment based on your recovery.

**Extra credit options** (from original post):
- Do 5 sets instead of 4 on main lifts
- Add chin-ups to every workout at 3-4 sets
- Add 2 extra squat sets on deadlift-focused days

### Is Ivysaur 4-4-8 good for beginners?

Yes, it's designed for lifters with 0-6 months of training experience. It teaches the fundamental barbell lifts while providing more upper body volume than Starting Strength or StrongLifts, which many beginners find leads to better overall development.

### How many days a week is Ivysaur 4-4-8?

3 days per week on non-consecutive days, typically Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday. The program uses a 2-week rotating cycle, so workouts alternate in content across weeks.

### How long should I run the Ivysaur 4-4-8 program?

Run it for 8-12 weeks, or until you start stalling on multiple lifts despite deloads. Most beginners will see good progress for 2-3 months before needing a program with more advanced periodization.

### What if I can't do chin-ups in Ivysaur 4-4-8?

Use band-assisted chin-ups or lat pulldowns at 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps until you build the strength for bodyweight chin-ups. The goal is to transition to actual chin-ups as soon as possible since they provide better strength and muscle development.

### How much weight should I add each week on Ivysaur 4-4-8?

Add 10lb/week to bench press and rows, 5lb/week to overhead press, and 15lb/week to squat and deadlift. If you hit 8+ reps on an AMRAP set, double that week's increase for that specific lift.

### What do I do when I stall on Ivysaur 4-4-8?

Keep the weight the same for one more week. If you stall a second consecutive week on the same lift, deload 10% and work back up. If you're stalling on multiple lifts regularly after 8-12 weeks, it's time to transition to a program with more advanced periodization.

### Why does Ivysaur 4-4-8 only squat 1-2 times per week?

The program prioritizes upper body frequency to address the common complaint that Starting Strength and StrongLifts undersupply chest, shoulder, and arm development. Squatting every session works early on but can interfere with deadlift progress and overall recovery as weights increase.
