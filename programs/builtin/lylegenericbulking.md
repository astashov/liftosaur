A 4-day upper/lower split designed by Lyle McDonald for intermediate lifters on a caloric surplus. Each muscle group is hit twice per week with a mix of heavy compounds (6-8 reps) and moderate-rep accessory work (10-12 and 12-15 reps). Progression is straightforward double progression: add reps within the prescribed range, then add weight when you hit the top.

## Origin & Philosophy

Lyle McDonald designed this routine and published it on his [bodyrecomposition.com](https://bodyrecomposition.com) forums around 2008-2009. It was later compiled and popularized through [JCDFitness](https://jcdfitness.com/2009/01/lyle-mcdonalds-bulking-routine/).

The core principle: training each muscle group twice per week with moderate volume and progressive overload is the most efficient way to grow during a bulk. Lyle specifically designed the routine to sit between low-volume approaches like Doggcrapp and high-volume bodybuilding splits. Enough stimulus per session to trigger growth, but not so much that you can't recover for the second session that week. Progressive tension overload (adding weight to the bar) is the primary driver of growth, with metabolic stress from higher-rep sets as a secondary stimulus.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (1-3 years of consistent training). You should be comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], and [{Bent Over Row}] form.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy with strength as a secondary benefit.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking phases with a caloric surplus of 250-500 calories above maintenance, aiming for 0.5-1lb of weight gain per week. Not ideal for cutting since the volume will be hard to recover from in a deficit.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Twice-per-week frequency per muscle group matches what research supports as optimal for hypertrophy
- Three distinct rep ranges (6-8, 10-12, 12-15) provide both mechanical tension and metabolic stress
- Simple structure with only two unique workouts, easy to learn and track
- Low isolation volume (2 sets each for biceps and triceps) keeps sessions to about 60-70 minutes
- Flexible set ranges (3-4, 2-3, 1-2) let you auto-regulate based on daily readiness

**Cons**

- No direct ab, rear delt, or lateral delt work. You'll need to add these yourself
- Repeating the exact same workout twice per week can feel monotonous after several cycles
- [{Squat}] and [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] back-to-back on lower days is fatiguing, and the SLDL suffers
- No built-in deload protocol. You need to self-manage fatigue over the 6-8 week cycle

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Upper/Lower
- **Periodization**: Double progression (add reps within range, then add weight)
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly, Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri (with Wed and weekends off)
- **Typical week**: Lower Body, Upper Body, Rest, Lower Body, Upper Body, Rest, Rest

Both lower body days are identical, and both upper body days are identical. Lyle suggests optionally varying exercises on the second session of the week (see Common Modifications).

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Lower Body** follows a quad-dominant, hip-dominant, quad-accessory, hamstring-accessory, calf pattern. [{Squat}] is the primary quad compound at heavy weight. [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] provides heavy hip-hinge work and stretches the hamstrings under load. [{Leg Press}] adds quad volume at moderate reps without the spinal fatigue of more squatting. [{Seated Leg Curl}] isolates the hamstrings through knee flexion (complementing the SLDL which works them through hip extension). Two calf exercises: [{Standing Calf Raise}] hits the gastrocnemius (straight-knee), [{Seated Calf Raise}] targets the soleus (bent-knee).

**Upper Body** alternates push/pull movements. [{Bench Press}] is the primary horizontal press. [{Bent Over Row}] is the primary horizontal pull, balancing the bench volume. [{Shoulder Press}] (dumbbell) adds vertical pressing volume at moderate reps. Lyle lists this as interchangeable with [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}]. [{Chin Up}] covers vertical pulling and adds bicep work. [{Skullcrusher}] and [{Hammer Curl}] provide direct arm work at high reps to round out the session.

**Substitution options**: [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] can be swapped for [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}]. [{Shoulder Press}] can be swapped for [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] or [{Overhead Press}]. [{Chin Up}] can be replaced with [{Lat Pulldown}] or [{Pull Up}]. [{Hammer Curl}] can be swapped for [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] or [{Bicep Curl}]. [{Skullcrusher}] can be swapped for [{Triceps Pushdown}] or [{Triceps Extension, Cable}].

## Set & Rep Scheme

The program uses three tiers of set/rep ranges, each targeting a different adaptation:

- **Main compounds** ([{Squat}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], [{Bench Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Standing Calf Raise}]): 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps. Heavy enough to build strength and create high mechanical tension, the primary driver of hypertrophy.
- **Secondary compounds** ([{Leg Press}], [{Seated Leg Curl}], [{Shoulder Press}], [{Chin Up}], [{Seated Calf Raise}]): 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps. Moderate weight accumulates volume and metabolic stress without the CNS drain of heavy sets.
- **Isolation** ([{Skullcrusher}], [{Hammer Curl}]): 1-2 sets of 12-15 reps. High reps with shorter rest periods for a pump. Arms already get significant indirect work from the compound movements, so direct volume is kept low.

Lyle recommends starting on the lower end of set ranges and adding sets as your work capacity improves. If the routine feels like too much, drop to 2-3x6-8 and 1-2x10-12.

## Progressive Overload

This implementation uses **double progression** for all exercises:

1. Start at the bottom of your rep range (e.g., 6 reps for a 6-8 range).
2. Each session, try to add reps: 4x6 -> 4x7 -> 4x8.
3. Once you hit the top of the range on all sets, add 5lb and reset to the bottom.

For example, [{Squat}] starts at 4x6. You work up to 4x8. Once you complete 4x8, the weight goes up by 5lb and you drop back to 4x6.

**When you stall**: If you can't add reps for 2-3 sessions, reduce weight by 10% and build back up. Lyle also recommends running the program in 6-8 week cycles, then taking a deload week (reduce volume by 40-50%) before starting a new cycle.

**Recommended cycle structure**: Lyle suggests 8-week cycles. Weeks 1-2 are a "submaximal run-up" using 85-95% of your working weights to ease in. Weeks 3-8 are full-effort progressive overload. Then deload and start a new cycle with slightly higher baseline weights.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run for **6-8 weeks per cycle**, with a deload week between cycles. You can repeat cycles for as long as you're in a caloric surplus and still progressing, typically 3-6 months during a dedicated bulk.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You're stalling on most exercises despite deloading, you're no longer in a surplus, or you want more variety. Transition to [PHUL](/programs/phul) (adds separate power/hypertrophy days), a **PPL split** (6 days/week for more volume), or [5/3/1 BBB](/programs/the531bbb) (if you want to shift toward strength).

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, dumbbells, leg press machine, seated leg curl machine, standing calf raise machine (or smith machine), seated calf raise machine.

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Leg Press}] -> [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Front Squat}]
- [{Seated Leg Curl}] -> [{Romanian Deadlift}] or [{Good Morning}]
- [{Standing Calf Raise}] -> [{Standing Calf Raise, Bodyweight}] (on a step with added weight)
- [{Seated Calf Raise}] -> [{Seated Calf Raise, Dumbbell}]
- [{Chin Up}] works as-is for home gyms with a pull-up bar

## Rest Times

- **6-8 rep exercises** ([{Squat}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], [{Bench Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Standing Calf Raise}]): **3 minutes**
- **10-12 rep exercises** ([{Leg Press}], [{Seated Leg Curl}], [{Shoulder Press}], [{Chin Up}], [{Seated Calf Raise}]): **2 minutes**
- **12-15 rep exercises** ([{Skullcrusher}], [{Hammer Curl}]): **90 seconds**

## How to Pick Starting Weights

For each exercise, pick a weight where you can complete all prescribed sets at the **bottom** of the rep range with 1-2 reps in reserve. For example, if the prescription is 4x6-8, choose a weight you could do for about 9-10 reps to failure. This gives you room to progress within the range.

**If you don't know your rep maxes**: Start conservatively. Use roughly 70-75% of what you think you could do for a heavy single. It's always better to start too light since the double progression will bring you up to the right working weights within 2-3 weeks.

**Common mistake**: Starting too heavy and immediately hitting the top of the rep range. This leaves no room for progression and defeats the purpose of double progression.

## Common Modifications

- **Vary the second session**: On the second Lower day, swap [{Squat}] for [{Deadlift}] or [{Front Squat}] and use [{Leg Press}] as the primary 6-8 rep movement. On the second Upper day, swap [{Bench Press}] for [{Incline Bench Press}] and [{Bent Over Row}] for [{Lat Pulldown}] or [{Pull Up}].
- **Add rear delts**: [{Face Pull}] or [{Reverse Fly}] for 2-3x15-20 at the end of upper body days. The program has zero direct rear delt work.
- **Add abs**: [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Cable Crunch}] for 2-3 sets at the end of lower body days.
- **Add lateral delts**: [{Lateral Raise}] for 2-3x12-15 at the end of upper body days.
- **Strength/hypertrophy variant**: Run the first session each week at 3-5x5 (strength focus) and the second session at 3x8-12 (hypertrophy focus). Lyle mentioned this as a valid long-term periodization approach.
- **Reduced volume**: If recovery is an issue, drop to 2-3x6-8 for main compounds and 1-2x10-12 for secondary lifts.

### Is Lyle's Generic Bulking good for beginners?

No, it's designed for intermediate lifters with 1-3 years of training experience. You should be comfortable with squat, bench, deadlift, and row form. If you're still making session-to-session progress, use a beginner program like GZCLP first.

### How many days a week is Lyle's Generic Bulking?

It's a 4-day upper/lower split, typically run Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Friday. Both lower body days are identical, and both upper body days are identical, making it very simple to follow.

### Do I need to be bulking to run this program?

The program is specifically designed for a caloric surplus (250-500 calories above maintenance). The volume and recovery demands assume adequate nutrition. It's not ideal for cutting since recovery will suffer in a deficit.

### How does progression work on Lyle's Generic Bulking?

All exercises use double progression. Start at the bottom of the rep range (e.g., 6 reps for a 6-8 range), work up to the top of the range on all sets, then add 5lb and reset. For example, squat goes 4x6 → 4x7 → 4x8, then add 5lb and drop back to 4x6.

### How long should I run Lyle's Generic Bulking?

Run it in 6-8 week cycles with a deload week between cycles. Weeks 1-2 can be a submaximal ramp-up using 85-95% of your working weights. You can repeat cycles for 3-6 months during a dedicated bulk.

### What exercises should I add to Lyle's Generic Bulking?

The program has no direct rear delt, lateral delt, or ab work. Add face pulls or reverse flyes for rear delts, lateral raises for side delts, and hanging leg raises or cable crunches for abs — 2-3 sets each at the end of the appropriate sessions.
