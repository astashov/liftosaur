A high-volume linear progression program that blends Wendler's 5/3/1 rep scheme with Sheiko-inspired volume. Each session pairs a heavy T1 compound lift (9 sets) with a lighter T2 compound lift (8 sets), plus accessories. Bench press is trained twice per week — once as a volume day and once as a 5/3/1 day. Weekly progression is driven by AMRAP performance on the T1 top set.

## Origin & Philosophy

nSuns LP was created by Reddit user [/u/nSuns](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/) around 2016-2017. The creator used this program to bring their squat/bench/deadlift total from 905 lbs to 1,215 lbs over roughly 6 months. The program became one of the most popular routines on Reddit, spawning its own subreddit (r/nSuns) with thousands of users sharing results and accessory recommendations.

The core idea is "Wendler in the front, Sheiko in the back" — each session opens with a 5/3/1-style ramp to a heavy AMRAP set (like Wendler), then follows with 6 high-volume backoff sets (like Sheiko). This gives you both the heavy singles/triples that build maximal strength and the accumulated volume that drives hypertrophy and technique refinement.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Late beginner to intermediate (6-18 months). You need solid technique on the big four lifts because you'll be handling heavy loads for many sets.
- **Primary goal**: Strength, with significant hypertrophy as a side effect from the high volume.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance with adequate caloric intake. The 17 compound sets per session create substantial fatigue — recovery suffers in a caloric deficit.
- **Prerequisites**: You should be comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}] form. If you can't maintain technique under fatigue, build that base first with a simpler program.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- [{Bench Press}] trained 2x/week (volume + 5/3/1) — builds pressing strength and technique faster than once-per-week programs
- AMRAP sets provide built-in auto-regulation: progression scales with performance (2-3 reps = +5lb, 4-5 reps = +10lb, 6+ reps = +15lb)
- High volume per session (17 working sets across two compound lifts) drives both strength and muscle growth
- Massive community on Reddit (r/nSuns) with accessory templates, troubleshooting, and thousands of user reviews
- Flexible accessory structure lets you target individual weak points

**Cons**

- Sessions routinely take 75-90 minutes including rest between the 17 compound sets
- Very pressing-heavy: 4 of the 5 T1/T2 pairings are pressing movements — you must add your own back work (rows, pull-ups) to stay balanced
- No built-in deload protocol — you need to self-manage fatigue by reducing your 1RM when you start failing AMRAPs
- Recovery-demanding due to high volume combined with aggressive linear progression — not suitable for cutting

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Each day pairs one T1 (primary) compound lift with one T2 (secondary) compound lift, plus 2 accessories
- **Periodization**: Linear progression — weights increase weekly based on AMRAP performance
- **Schedule**: Fixed 5-day weekly rotation. Typically Mon-Fri with weekends off, or any 5 days that allow at least one rest day per week
- **Layout**: Day 1 is a bench volume day with a unique pyramid scheme. Days 2-5 follow the 5/3/1 pattern (ramp to a heavy AMRAP, then backoff sets)

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**T1 (Primary) lifts** rotate through the big four:
- [{Bench Press}] appears twice — Day 1 as a volume day (pyramid up to 85% TM, then descend) and Day 5 as a standard 5/3/1 day. The double exposure is deliberate: bench responds well to frequency, and the two distinct rep schemes provide both heavy practice and accumulated volume.
- [{Squat}] (Day 2) and [{Deadlift}] (Day 4) each get one 5/3/1 day. They're on separate days to avoid competing for lower body recovery.
- [{Overhead Press}] (Day 3) gets its own 5/3/1 day, providing direct shoulder pressing volume that also supports bench strength.

**T2 (Secondary) lifts** are chosen to complement the T1 pattern:
- [{Overhead Press}] (Day 1 T2) — pressing variation that supports bench day. Lighter pressing volume trains shoulders without interfering with the heavy bench work.
- [{Sumo Deadlift}] (Day 2 T2) — hip-dominant pull that provides deadlift-pattern volume on squat day. The sumo stance shifts emphasis to hips and adductors.
- [{Incline Bench Press}] (Day 3 T2) — upper chest and front delt emphasis that supports both OHP and flat bench strength.
- [{Front Squat}] (Day 4 T2) — quad-dominant squat variation on deadlift day. Builds the quad strength and upright torso position that carry over to conventional deadlift and back squat.
- [{Bench Press Close Grip}] (Day 5 T2) — targets triceps lockout strength, the most common bench press sticking point.

**Accessories** are not prescribed by the original program — you choose 2-4 per day based on your weak points. This implementation includes 2 per day as a starting point. The most important addition is pulling work (rows, pull-ups) on every session to balance the heavy pressing volume.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**T1 Volume Day** (Day 1 [{Bench Press}] only): 9 sets that pyramid up to 3x4 at 85% TM, then descend back down with increasing reps. The final set is AMRAP. This pattern provides ~50 total reps of bench pressing at moderate-to-heavy loads.

**T1 5/3/1 Days** (Days 2-5): 9 sets starting with a 5/3/1 ramp — 5 reps at 75% TM, 3 reps at 85% TM, then 1+ AMRAP at 95% TM. The remaining 6 sets are backoff work at decreasing percentages. The backoff rep pattern varies by lift:
- [{Squat}] and [{Overhead Press}]: 3/3/3/5/5/5+ reps
- [{Deadlift}]: 3/3/3/3/3/3+ reps (lower backoff reps to manage spinal fatigue)
- [{Bench Press}]: 3/5/3/5/3/5+ reps (alternating pattern)

The AMRAP set at 95% TM is the most important set in the program — it determines your weekly progression.

**T2 exercises**: 8 sets ramping from ~50% to ~70% TM, then staying at ~70% for the remaining sets with varying reps (3-8 per set). The rep pattern undulates (3/5/7/4/6/8 on the working sets) to provide both strength and hypertrophy stimulus at moderate intensity. Total T2 volume is ~44 reps per exercise.

## Progressive Overload

After each session, the app checks your AMRAP performance on the T1 top set (set 3 at 95% TM). Based on reps achieved:
- **2-3 reps**: Increase 1RM by **5 lbs**
- **4-5 reps**: Increase 1RM by **10 lbs**
- **6+ reps**: Increase 1RM by **15 lbs**
- **0-1 reps**: No increase (weight was too heavy)

This AMRAP-based progression means the program auto-adjusts: if your 1RM is set correctly, you'll typically hit 2-3 reps and progress by 5 lbs/week. If you set it too conservatively, you'll hit 5+ reps and catch up quickly.

**T2 exercises** increase 1RM linearly after each successful session: **+5 lbs** for upper body T2 lifts ([{Bench Press Close Grip}], [{Incline Bench Press}]), **+10 lbs** for lower body T2 lifts ([{Sumo Deadlift}], [{Front Squat}]). [{Overhead Press}] T2 weights scale automatically from the OHP T1 AMRAP-based progression since they share the same 1RM.

**When you stall**: If you consistently get only 1 rep on the AMRAP (or fail it entirely), reduce your 1RM by 10% and rebuild. There is no formal deload week — just reset and progress again.

**Accessories** use double progression: increase reps within a range (e.g., 8 to 12), then add 5 lbs and reset to the bottom of the range.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run nSuns LP for **12-20 weeks**. It's designed for aggressive linear gains, and most lifters will eventually outpace their recovery capacity.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You're consistently getting only 1 rep on AMRAPs even after a 10% reset, sessions are taking 90+ minutes because you need longer rest periods, or you're dreading the volume.

**Transition to**: [5/3/1 Boring But Big](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big) (slower progression, still high volume), GZCL The Rippler (periodized intermediate program), or any intermediate program with built-in periodization. nSuns LP is a bridge between beginner linear progression and true intermediate programming.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, squat rack, flat bench, and weight plates for all T1 and T2 lifts. A cable machine for [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Triceps Pushdown}], and [{Face Pull}]. Dumbbells for [{Bicep Curl}], [{Hammer Curl}], and [{Lateral Raise}]. A pull-up bar for [{Chin Up}].

**Home gym substitutions** (for cable/machine exercises):
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}] (bodyweight)
- [{Triceps Pushdown}] → [{Skullcrusher}] (barbell or dumbbell)
- [{Face Pull}] → [{Reverse Fly}] (dumbbell) or band pull-apart
- [{Leg Extension}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] (dumbbell or bodyweight)

## Rest Times

- **T1 sets**: **2-3 minutes** between working sets. Take up to **4 minutes** after the AMRAP top set before starting backoff work.
- **T2 sets**: **90-120 seconds**. The intensity is lower, so you shouldn't need more.
- **Accessories**: **60-90 seconds**. Superset pulling and pressing accessories to save time.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

For T1 lifts, set your **1 Rep Max** (1RM) in the app. This program uses percentages of 1RM directly — the original TM-based percentages have been pre-converted (TM = 90% of 1RM). If you don't know your 1RM, work up to a weight you can lift for 3-5 clean reps and use the app's 1RM calculator.

**Calibration check**: On your first week, the AMRAP set is at 85% of 1RM (= 95% TM). You should be able to hit **3-5 reps** on this set. If you can only get 1 rep, your 1RM is set too high — reduce by 5-10%. If you hit 8+ reps, it's set too low.

For T2 lifts, each exercise uses its own 1RM. Set these based on your actual max for each exercise. The T2 working weights will be ~45-63% of each exercise's 1RM.

For accessories, start with the default weights and adjust up or down based on feel.

## Common Modifications

- **4-day variant**: Drop Day 3 ([{Overhead Press}] T1 + [{Incline Bench Press}] T2). OHP then only appears as a T2 exercise on Day 1. This is the original version of the program.
- **6-day squat variant**: Add a 6th day with extra [{Squat}] volume (8x3 at ~72% TM) and [{Sumo Deadlift}] volume (6x3 at ~56% TM).
- **6-day deadlift variant**: Add a 6th day with extra [{Deadlift}] volume and [{Front Squat}] volume.
- **More back work**: The most common modification. Add [{Bent Over Row}] or [{Pull Up}] sets to every session. Many users do 50-100 total reps of pulling per session to balance the pressing volume.
- **Different T2 exercises**: [{Sumo Deadlift}] can be replaced with [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] or [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}]. [{Front Squat}] can be swapped for [{Leg Press}]. [{Bench Press Close Grip}] can be replaced with [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}].
- **Row variant**: Replace [{Overhead Press}] T2 on Day 1 with [{Bent Over Row}] for lifters who need more back volume.

### Is nSuns good for beginners?

nSuns LP is not ideal for true beginners. It's best suited for late beginners to intermediates with 6-18 months of training experience. You need solid technique on squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press because you'll be handling heavy loads across 17 compound sets per session.

### How many days a week is nSuns?

nSuns is a 5-day program, typically run Monday through Friday with weekends off. There are also popular 4-day and 6-day variants if you need to adjust the schedule.

### How long should I run nSuns?

Run nSuns LP for 12-20 weeks. It's designed for aggressive linear gains. If you're consistently only hitting 1 rep on AMRAPs even after resetting your 1RM, it's time to move to an intermediate program like 5/3/1 BBB or GZCL The Rippler.

### How does progression work on nSuns?

Progression is based on your AMRAP performance on the T1 top set each session. Hit 2-3 reps and your 1RM goes up 5 lbs, 4-5 reps adds 10 lbs, and 6+ reps adds 15 lbs. If you only get 0-1 reps, the weight stays the same.

### How long do nSuns workouts take?

Sessions routinely take 75-90 minutes because of the 17 compound working sets (9 T1 + 8 T2) plus accessories. Rest times of 2-3 minutes on T1 sets add up quickly. Supersetting accessories with T2 sets can save some time.

### What accessories should I add to nSuns?

The program doesn't prescribe specific accessories — you choose 2-4 per day. The most important addition is pulling work like rows and pull-ups on every session, since 4 of 5 days involve pressing movements and the program is very pressing-heavy.
