Jim Wendler's go-to supplemental template for the 5/3/1 system. Each session trains one main barbell lift through the 5/3/1 rep scheme with an AMRAP top set, then repeats the first working set's weight for 5 sets of 5 reps (First Set Last). Finished off with push, pull, and single-leg/core assistance work for 50-100 reps per category.

## Origin & Philosophy

First Set Last (FSL) was introduced in Jim Wendler's *Beyond 5/3/1* and expanded in [*5/3/1 Forever*](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/5x5-first-set-last-vs-boring-but-big). Wendler — a former Westside Barbell trainee who squatted 1,000 lbs — created FSL as a supplemental template that prioritizes bar speed and recovery over raw volume. The name describes the mechanic: after your heavy 5/3/1 working sets, you go back to the weight from your first set and do 5 more sets of 5 reps.

Wendler's reasoning: "FSL work kicks a ton of ass at 5x5 because you get great work, your form is totally locked in and you don't run yourself down." Compared to higher-volume templates like [Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb), FSL is easier to recover from while still driving meaningful strength and technique gains.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Late beginner to intermediate (6-24 months). You should know how to [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}] with decent form.
- **Primary goal**: Strength with moderate hypertrophy from the assistance work.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking, maintenance, or even a conservative cut. FSL's moderate supplemental volume (25 reps vs BBB's 50) makes it one of the few 5/3/1 templates that works across caloric conditions. Also well-suited for lifters who are active outside the gym (sports, running, hiking) because the recovery cost is low.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Sessions run 60-75 minutes, or under 60 if you superset assistance work — the 5x5 FSL sets move fast at submaximal weight
- Recoverable enough to pair with conditioning, sports, or an active lifestyle without tanking performance
- The AMRAP top set provides auto-regulation — if you're having a bad day, you hit the minimum reps; good days give you rep PRs
- Works on a cut, maintenance, or bulk — unlike BBB which demands a caloric surplus
- The 5x5 supplemental sets lock in technique at moderate loads without grinding

**Cons**

- Less hypertrophy stimulus than [Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) — if your primary goal is muscle size, BBB or [Building the Monolith](/programs/monolith531) will deliver more
- The FSL weight can feel very light in Week 1 (58% of 1RM), which some lifters find unmotivating
- Assistance work is intentionally unstructured (50-100 reps of push/pull/core) — lifters who want exact sets and reps for accessories may feel lost
- Fixed 5/10 lb monthly increments feel slow for stronger beginners who could progress faster on a linear program like [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp)

## Program Structure

- **Split**: One main lift per day across 4 days (Squat / Bench Press / Deadlift / Overhead Press)
- **Periodization**: Weekly undulating — the main lift rep scheme changes each week (5s / 3s / 5/3/1) while FSL supplemental volume stays at 5x5
- **Cycle**: 3 working weeks per cycle, with a TM test or deload every 2 cycles (7th week protocol)
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — commonly Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri, or any arrangement with at least one rest day between lower body sessions

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Each day centers on one of the four main barbell lifts: [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}]. These are the only exercises that follow the 5/3/1 progression and receive FSL supplemental volume.

**Assistance work** follows Wendler's push/pull/single-leg-or-core framework:
- **Squat day**: [{Chin Up}] for vertical pulling to balance the pressing volume across the week, [{Hanging Leg Raise}] for core stability, [{Triceps Dip}] for pressing volume
- **Bench Press day**: [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] for horizontal pulling to offset bench pressing, [{Face Pull}] for rear delt and shoulder health, [{Bicep Curl}] for arm volume
- **Deadlift day**: [{Pull Up}] for back width, [{Ab Wheel}] for anterior core, [{Lunge}] for unilateral leg work and additional quad volume
- **OHP day**: [{Lat Pulldown}] for vertical pulling, [{Push Up}] for additional pressing volume at low intensity, [{Hanging Leg Raise}] for core

These are all freely swappable — Wendler's philosophy is that the specific exercise doesn't matter as long as you hit push, pull, and single-leg/core each session for 50-100 reps per category.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Main 5/3/1 work** follows the standard wave. Percentages in this Liftosaur implementation are expressed as **% of 1RM** (pre-converted from Training Max, assuming TM = 90% of 1RM):

- **Week 1 (5s)**: 1x5 @ 58%, 1x5 @ 67%, 1x5+ @ 76%
- **Week 2 (3s)**: 1x3 @ 63%, 1x3 @ 72%, 1x3+ @ 81%
- **Week 3 (5/3/1)**: 1x5 @ 67%, 1x3 @ 76%, 1x1+ @ 85%

The final set each week is AMRAP — do as many reps as possible while maintaining bar speed and form. Stop when the bar slows significantly or form degrades. Don't grind to absolute failure.

**FSL supplemental work**: 5 sets of 5 reps at the same weight as the first working set. This is 58% of 1RM in Week 1, 63% in Week 2, and 67% in Week 3. These should feel moderate — bar speed should be fast and form should be clean on every rep.

**Assistance work**: 50-100 total reps per category (push/pull/single-leg or core), done at moderate effort. Set and rep scheme is flexible — 5x10, 3x15, or any combination that reaches the target reps.

## Progressive Overload

After completing each 3-week cycle, increase your 1RM:
- **[{Overhead Press}] and [{Bench Press}]**: +5 lbs
- **[{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}]**: +10 lbs

These increments are fixed regardless of how many reps you hit on the AMRAP sets. The slow progression is by design — Wendler's principle is "start too light."

**When you stall**: If you can't hit the prescribed minimum reps on AMRAP sets (5 on Week 1, 3 on Week 2, 1 on Week 3) for a full cycle, your TM is too high. Reduce your 1RM by 3 cycle increments (15 lbs for upper body, 30 lbs for lower body) and rebuild.

**7th Week Protocol**: Every 2 cycles (6 weeks of training), take a TM test week. Work up to your TM for 3-5 reps. If you get 3+ reps, your TM is appropriate. If not, recalculate. This replaces the older "deload every 4th week" approach from the original 5/3/1.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run FSL indefinitely — it's one of the most sustainable 5/3/1 templates. Many lifters use it as their "default" supplemental template and run it for months or years.

**Signs it's time to change**: You want more hypertrophy stimulus (switch to [Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb)), you want a short-term challenge ([Building the Monolith](/programs/monolith531)), or you've been running the same template for 6+ months and want variety.

**Leader/Anchor cycling** (from *Forever*): FSL works as both a leader and anchor template. A common cycle is 2 leader cycles of 5s PRO + FSL (no AMRAP, just 5 reps across), followed by 1 anchor cycle of standard 5/3/1 + FSL (with AMRAP sets). This implementation uses the anchor version with AMRAP sets.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, squat rack, bench, weight plates, and a pull-up bar for main lifts and pulling accessories. A lat pulldown machine and dumbbells are helpful for the assistance work but not required.

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Chin Up}] or [{Pull Up}] (bodyweight)
- [{Face Pull}] → [{Reverse Fly}] with dumbbells or band pull-aparts
- [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] → [{Bent Over Row}] with barbell or [{Inverted Row}]
- [{Lunge}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Goblet Squat}]

## Rest Times

- **Main 5/3/1 sets**: **3-5 minutes** between working sets. The AMRAP set may need extra rest before FSL work.
- **FSL 5x5 sets**: **90-120 seconds**. The weight is submaximal — keep these moving to maintain training density.
- **Assistance work**: **60-90 seconds**. Can be supersetted across categories (e.g., chin-ups between dip sets) to save time.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

1. For each main lift, estimate or test your **1 Rep Max** (1RM). This Liftosaur program uses 1RM directly — all working percentages are pre-converted from Wendler's TM-based percentages (assuming TM = 90% of 1RM).
2. Set your 1RM in the app and all weights calculate automatically.

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Work up to a weight you can do for 3-5 clean reps with good bar speed. Use Brzycki's formula: 1RM = weight / (1.0278 - 0.0278 x reps). Or use the Liftosaur 1RM calculator.

**Common mistake**: Setting your 1RM too high. Wendler's core principle is "start too light." On Week 1, you should be getting 8-10+ reps on the AMRAP set. If you're only getting 5, your 1RM is inflated.

## Common Modifications

- **5s PRO + FSL** (from *Forever*): Replace the AMRAP sets with straight sets of 5 across all 3 weeks. Reduces fatigue and is Wendler's preferred "leader" setup. Use standard 5/3/1 + FSL (with AMRAP) as the "anchor" every 3rd cycle to test progress.
- **FSL Widowmaker**: Instead of 5x5, do 1 set of 15-20 reps at the FSL weight. Faster but more mentally demanding. Good if you're short on time.
- **Swap to SSL (Second Set Last)**: Use the second working set's percentage for supplemental work instead of the first. Adds ~5% more intensity (67%/72%/76% of 1RM) for lifters who find FSL too light.
- **Add [{Face Pull}]**: 3-5 sets of 15-20 reps on all training days for shoulder health — the program involves heavy pressing 4x/week.
- **Conditioning**: Wendler recommends 2-3 conditioning sessions per week on off days — walking, light running, prowler work, or cycling.

### Is 5/3/1 FSL good for beginners?

FSL works for late beginners (6+ months of lifting) who have solid form on squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press. If you're brand new to barbell training, start with [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b), which uses the same FSL supplemental work but in a 3-day full-body format with more practice frequency on each lift.

### How many days a week is 5/3/1 FSL?

It's a 4-day program, typically Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Friday. Each day focuses on one main barbell lift followed by 5x5 FSL supplemental work and assistance exercises covering push, pull, and single-leg/core categories.

### What is the difference between 5/3/1 FSL and BBB?

FSL uses 5 sets of 5 reps at the first working set's weight (58-67% of 1RM). BBB uses 5 sets of 10 reps at 50% of 1RM. FSL is 25 supplemental reps per session vs BBB's 50. FSL is easier to recover from and works on a cut; BBB builds more muscle but demands a caloric surplus.

### How does progression work on 5/3/1 FSL?

After each 3-week cycle, add 5 lbs to your overhead press and bench press 1RM, and 10 lbs to your squat and deadlift 1RM. Every 2 cycles, take a TM test week to verify your weights are appropriate. If you can't hit minimum reps on AMRAP sets for a full cycle, reduce your 1RM.

### Can I run 5/3/1 FSL on a cut?

Yes — FSL is one of the best 5/3/1 templates for cutting. The supplemental volume is moderate (5x5 at submaximal weight), so recovery demands are manageable even in a caloric deficit. You may want to reduce assistance work to 25-50 reps per category if fatigue becomes an issue.

### How long should I run 5/3/1 FSL?

FSL can be run indefinitely. It's a sustainable, low-fatigue template that many lifters use as their default program. Common approaches include cycling it with higher-volume templates like BBB (e.g., 2-3 cycles of FSL followed by 2-3 cycles of BBB) for variety.

### What is the 7th week protocol in 5/3/1?

The 7th week protocol replaces the old "deload every 4th week" approach. After every 2 three-week cycles (6 weeks of training), you take a week to either deload or test your Training Max. Work up to your TM for 3-5 reps — if you hit 3+, your TM is good. If not, recalculate.

### What assistance exercises should I do with 5/3/1 FSL?

Wendler prescribes 50-100 reps each of push, pull, and single-leg/core exercises every session. The specific exercises don't matter much — chin-ups, dips, rows, push-ups, lunges, and ab work are all popular choices. Pick movements you enjoy and rotate as desired.
