## Origin & Philosophy

Deep Water Method was created by Jon Andersen, an IFBB Pro bodybuilder and former strongman who overcame catastrophic injuries to return to elite-level strength. The program emerged from his philosophy that most training failures stem from mental limitations rather than physical ones.

The core principle is simple but punishing: complete 100 reps of a compound movement in 10 sets of 10 reps, starting with 4-minute rest periods and gradually reducing rest to 2 minutes while maintaining the same weight. The program forces adaptation through density progression rather than load progression, building extreme work capacity and mental toughness.

Jon made the original Deep Water ebook freely available at his website to help others break through their training plateaus.

## Who It's For

Deep Water is for intermediate to advanced lifters with at least 1-3 years of consistent training experience. You should be comfortable with proper form on [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Push Press}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Barbell Row}] before attempting this program.

Minimum requirements: ability to squat your bodyweight for 10 reps with good form, and deadlift 1.5x bodyweight for 10 reps. If you cannot meet these standards, build your base strength with a beginner linear progression program first.

This program works for both strength and hypertrophy goals. The high volume drives muscle growth while the heavy compound work maintains strength. It's suitable for maintaining or bulking, but not recommended during a cut due to the extreme training demands.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Dramatically improves work capacity and conditioning in just 6 weeks
- High frequency on squats (alternating with deadlifts) builds technique quickly
- Simple structure - you don't need to track complex percentages or make workout-to-workout decisions
- Mental toughness carryover to other areas of training and life
- Significant hypertrophy from high volume on compound movements
- Free program with detailed ebook from the author

**Cons:**
- Extremely demanding - sessions regularly take 60-90 minutes due to rest periods
- High recovery demands may interfere with other athletic activities
- Not optimal for peaking 1RM strength - it's a general strength program
- The 10x10 days are mentally exhausting and require significant mental preparation
- Not suitable for cutting or calorie deficit due to high training stress
- Limited direct arm work - biceps and triceps are hit indirectly

## Program Structure

Deep Water is a 4-day per week lifting split with an optional 5th conditioning day. Days 1 and 3 are the signature "Deep Water days" featuring 10x10 work. Day 1 alternates between 10x10 [{Squat}] and 10x10 [{Deadlift}] each week. Day 3 features 10x10 [{Push Press}]. Days 2 and 4 are bodybuilding-style back and chest days respectively.

The program uses density progression: you maintain the same weight throughout all 6 weeks while rest periods decrease every 2 weeks (4 minutes in weeks 1-2, 3 minutes in weeks 3-4, 2 minutes in weeks 5-6). This forces your work capacity to improve dramatically.

The weekly structure is fixed, not rotating. You complete the same 4 days each week with the squat/deadlift alternation being the only variation.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

The program is built around three core 10x10 movements: [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Push Press}]. These compound movements were chosen because they recruit the most muscle mass and provide the greatest metabolic stress. The [{Push Press}] is used instead of strict [{Overhead Press}] to allow more weight and volume.

Day 2 (back day) includes [{Power Clean}], [{Barbell Row}], [{Shrug}], and [{Pull Up}] to build the entire posterior chain. Day 4 (chest day) uses [{Bench Press}], [{Incline Bench Press}], [{Bench Press Close Grip}], [{Chest Dip}], and [{Push Up}] for complete chest, shoulder, and triceps development.

Exercise substitutions are not recommended for the three main 10x10 movements. For accessory movements, you can substitute similar exercises (e.g., [{Chin Up}] for [{Pull Up}], [{Dumbbell Row}] for [{Barbell Row}]).

## Set & Rep Scheme

The signature Deep Water sets are 10 sets of 10 reps (100 total reps) using the same weight for all sets. This is done for one major movement on Days 1 and 3.

Accessory work uses more moderate rep schemes: 3-5 sets of 8-10 reps for most exercises. The program includes some AMRAP (as many reps as possible) sets to push past perceived limits. For example, [{Chest Dip}] and [{Push Up}] are done for 3 sets to failure.

Intensity for 10x10 work is approximately 70% of your 10-rep max, which translates to about 49-50% of your 1RM. This is lighter than you think - the challenge comes from the total volume, not the weight per set. If you can complete all 100 reps in weeks 1-2, the weight is correct. If you cannot, it's too heavy.

## Progressive Overload

Deep Water uses density progression, not load progression. You use the same weight for all 6 weeks on the 10x10 movements. Progression comes from completing 100 reps with progressively shorter rest periods: 4 minutes between sets in weeks 1-2, 3 minutes in weeks 3-4, and 2 minutes in weeks 5-6.

For accessory exercises, use linear progression: add 5lb to upper body movements and 10lb to lower body movements after successfully completing all prescribed reps. If you fail to complete all reps, repeat the same weight next week.

There is no formal deload built into the 6 weeks. The program is designed to be run for exactly 6 weeks, then you should take a deload week or transition to a different program.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run Deep Water for exactly 6 weeks as written. Do not extend it beyond 6 weeks - the program is designed as a short-term shock to your system, not a long-term training approach.

After completing Deep Water, take a full deload week with 50% volume and intensity before starting your next program. Your work capacity will be dramatically improved, so you can handle more volume in subsequent training blocks.

Signs it's time to move on: completion of the 6 weeks. This program has a defined endpoint.

Good programs to transition to: programs that leverage your improved work capacity like [{5/3/1: Building the Monolith}](/programs/531-building-the-monolith), [{nSuns LP}](/programs/nsuns-5-day-lp), or bodybuilding splits with high volume.

## Equipment Needed

The program requires a barbell, full set of weight plates, squat rack, bench, and pull-up bar. As written, all exercises are barbell-based or bodyweight.

If you don't have a barbell: this program is not suitable for dumbbell or machine substitutions. The loading required for 10x10 work demands a barbell.

If you don't have a pull-up bar: substitute [{Lat Pulldown}] for [{Pull Up}] and [{Chin Up}].

## Rest Times

For 10x10 work: rest periods are prescribed and non-negotiable. Weeks 1-2 use 4 minutes, weeks 3-4 use 3 minutes, weeks 5-6 use 2 minutes. These rest periods are what drive the adaptation. Do not rest longer - the point is to complete 100 reps within these constraints.

For accessory work: rest 90-120 seconds between sets for compound movements ([{Power Clean}], [{Barbell Row}], [{Bench Press}]). Rest 60-90 seconds for isolation work ([{Shrug}], [{Bicep Curl}]).

For bodyweight exercises to failure ([{Dip}], [{Push Up}]): rest as needed, typically 2-3 minutes to allow full recovery between sets.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

For 10x10 movements: calculate 70% of your 10-rep max. To find your 10RM, multiply your 1RM by 0.77. Then multiply that 10RM by 0.70 to get your starting weight. For example, if your squat 1RM is 300lb: 300 × 0.77 = 231lb (10RM), then 231 × 0.70 = 162lb (starting weight). Round to the nearest 5lb increment.

Common mistake: starting too heavy. If you cannot complete 80+ reps in your first 10x10 workout, the weight is too heavy. It should feel almost embarrassingly light for the first 3-4 sets. The weight will feel very different by sets 8-10 with only 4 minutes rest.

For accessory exercises: start with weights you can comfortably complete for all prescribed sets and reps. These should be challenging but not to failure except where explicitly noted (AMRAP sets).

You can adjust your 1RM in the app by tapping the exercise name and using the built-in 1RM calculator if you don't know your maxes.

## Common Modifications

**Conditioning day:** Week 1-2 do 20 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, light jogging, swimming). Weeks 3-4 add hill sprints or stair intervals. Weeks 5-6 use sled pushes or prowler work if available.

**Exercise substitutions:** The three main 10x10 movements ([{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Push Press}]) should not be substituted. For accessories: [{Chin Up}] can replace [{Pull Up}], [{Dumbbell Row}] can replace [{Barbell Row}], any dip variation works for [{Chest Dip}].

**Schedule variation:** If you cannot train 4 days per week, this program is not suitable. The specific 4-day structure is essential to recovery. If you must adjust, maintain at least 1 rest day between Day 1 and Day 2, and between Day 3 and Day 4.

**Adding exercises:** Do not add exercises to Deep Water days (Days 1 and 3). You can add 1-2 arm exercises to Days 2 or 4 if desired (e.g., [{Bicep Curl}], [{Triceps Extension}]).

## FAQ

### Is Deep Water Method good for beginners?

No. Deep Water requires at least 1-3 years of consistent training experience. The program demands proper form under extreme fatigue, which is unsafe for beginners. If you're new to training, start with a linear progression program like [Basic Beginner Routine](/programs/basic-beginner-routine) or [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) to build your base strength and technique.

### How long does each Deep Water workout take?

Deep Water days (Days 1 and 3) typically take 60-90 minutes due to the 10x10 work with rest periods. The 100 reps alone take 40 minutes in weeks 1-2 (10 sets × 4 minutes rest), not counting warmups and accessory work. Bodybuilding days (Days 2 and 4) take 45-60 minutes.

### Can I run Deep Water while cutting?

Not recommended. The program's extreme training stress requires adequate calories and carbohydrates for recovery. Most people need to maintain or bulk during Deep Water. Attempting this program in a deficit significantly increases injury risk and makes completion unlikely.

### What if I can't complete all 100 reps on the 10x10 days?

If you fail to complete 100 reps, the weight is too heavy. Reduce the weight by 10-15% for your next session. It's better to complete all 100 reps with lighter weight than to fail at 70-80 reps with heavier weight. The program is about density and work capacity, not maximum load.

### How should I warm up for the 10x10 sets?

Use standard progressive warmup: empty bar for 10 reps, then 50% of working weight for 5 reps, then 75% for 3 reps. Don't overdo warmups - you need to conserve energy for the 100 working reps. The first 2-3 work sets will feel easy and function as additional warmup.

### What should I do after completing Deep Water Method?

Take a full deload week (50% volume and intensity) to recover. Your work capacity is now dramatically higher, so you can handle more volume in your next program. Good follow-ups include [{5/3/1: Building the Monolith}](/programs/531-building-the-monolith), [{nSuns LP}](/programs/nsuns-5-day-lp), or high-volume bodybuilding splits.

### Do I increase weight during the 6 weeks?

No. The 10x10 movements stay at the same weight for all 6 weeks. Progressive overload comes from completing 100 reps with shorter rest periods (4min → 3min → 2min). For accessory exercises, add weight when you successfully complete all sets and reps as prescribed.

### Why use Push Press instead of strict Overhead Press for 10x10?

[{Push Press}] allows you to handle more weight and volume than strict [{Overhead Press}], which generates more overall stimulus. The leg drive reduces shoulder strain over 100 reps. Jon Andersen chose [{Push Press}] specifically for its ability to train the entire body under high volume.
