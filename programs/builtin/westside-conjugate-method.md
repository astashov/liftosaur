A 4-day upper/lower program built on Louie Simmons's Conjugate Method from Westside Barbell. Each body part gets one max effort day (work up to a 1-3 rep max) and one dynamic effort day (speed work at submaximal percentages). Exercise variations rotate every 3 weeks to prevent accommodation. Accessories target weak points with higher-rep bodybuilding work. Adapted for raw lifters using straight weight (no bands or chains required).

## Origin & Philosophy

The Conjugate Method was developed by Louie Simmons at [Westside Barbell](https://www.westside-barbell.com/pages/conjugate-method) in Columbus, Ohio, and popularized through his *Book of Methods* (2007) and *The Conjugate Method* book. The system draws on Soviet sports science — particularly the work of Verkhoshansky and Zatsiorsky — and applies concurrent training: developing maximal strength, speed-strength, and muscular endurance simultaneously rather than in separate blocks.

The core insight is the **Law of Accommodation**: if you repeat the same stimulus, your body stops adapting. Westside avoids this by rotating exercise variations every 1-3 weeks and training multiple strength qualities every week. This contrasts with linear periodization programs where you focus on one quality at a time (volume → intensity → peaking). The result is a system where you can train max effort heavy lifting year-round without burning out, because the variation constantly shifts the stress.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Advanced (2+ years of serious barbell training). You need solid technique on [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Deadlift}] because the program assumes you can auto-regulate max effort attempts and select appropriate variations.
- **Prerequisites**: You should know your approximate 1RMs and be comfortable working up to heavy singles. A minimum of 1x bodyweight bench, 1.5x bodyweight squat, and 2x bodyweight deadlift is a reasonable baseline.
- **Primary goal**: Maximal strength and power development for powerlifting or general strength.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance. Not ideal for a cut — the max effort work requires full recovery.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Each lift is trained twice per week (once heavy, once fast), providing high frequency without excessive fatigue on any single session
- Exercise rotation every 3 weeks prevents staleness and addresses weak points directly
- Dynamic effort days develop bar speed and rate of force development, which carry over to heavier lifts
- The template is flexible — you can swap exercise variations to target your specific weaknesses
- Concurrent training means you never lose any quality (strength, speed, or muscle mass) during a training cycle

**Cons**

- Requires self-regulation on max effort days — picking the right weight to work up to takes experience
- The original system relies heavily on bands, chains, and specialty bars; this adaptation uses straight weight which limits some of the speed-strength benefits
- No built-in peaking protocol — you need to add one separately if preparing for a meet
- Max effort days can be hard on joints if you consistently push to true 1RMs; working to a 3RM instead of 1RM is recommended for longevity
- Sessions can run 75+ minutes with warmups, working up, and 3-4 accessories

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Upper/Lower with Max Effort and Dynamic Effort variants
- **Periodization style**: Conjugate (concurrent) — max effort, dynamic effort, and repeated effort are all trained every week
- **Cycle length**: 3-week waves, repeating indefinitely
- **Typical week**: ME Lower → ME Upper → rest → DE Lower → DE Upper → rest → rest
- **Exercise rotation**: Main lift variations change every 3 weeks; accessories use double progression and can be swapped based on weak points

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Max Effort Lower** rotates between [{Squat}] (week 1), [{Deficit Deadlift}] (week 2), and [{Front Squat}] (week 3). These three movements stress different parts of the squat/deadlift chain — [{Squat}] builds overall strength, [{Deficit Deadlift}] strengthens the pull off the floor and the posterior chain, and [{Front Squat}] targets quad strength and upright torso positioning. Accessories emphasize the posterior chain ([{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}], [{Reverse Hyperextension}]) and core ([{Ab Wheel}]).

**Max Effort Upper** rotates between [{Bench Press Close Grip}] (week 1), [{Incline Bench Press}] (week 2), and [{Bench Press}] with a pause (week 3). [{Bench Press Close Grip}] overloads the triceps (a common bench press weak point), [{Incline Bench Press}] develops upper chest and front delt strength, and a paused [{Bench Press}] builds strength off the chest. Accessories target triceps ([{Skullcrusher}]), upper back ([{Seated Row}]), and shoulders ([{Face Pull}]).

**Dynamic Effort Lower** uses [{Box Squat}] for speed work — the box teaches you to sit back, breaks the eccentric-concentric chain (building starting strength), and allows consistent depth. Speed [{Deadlift}] follows. Accessories are lighter posterior chain and single-leg work.

**Dynamic Effort Upper** uses [{Bench Press}] for speed sets with varied rep schemes. Grip width changes across the 3 weeks (close → medium → wide) to develop strength across positions. Accessories focus on triceps and upper back volume.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Max Effort work**: Work up over 5-6 progressively heavier sets to a 1-3 rep max. The top set should be at RPE 9-10 (1 rep or less in the tank). This is the heaviest work of the week and recruits the highest-threshold motor units.

**Dynamic Effort Squat**: 10x2 (week 1), 10x2 (week 2), 8x2 (week 3) at 70%, 75%, and 80% of 1RM respectively. Every rep must be maximally explosive — if bar speed slows noticeably, reduce the weight. Rest 45-60 seconds between sets to maintain density.

**Dynamic Effort Bench**: 9x3 at 55%, 60%, and 65% of 1RM across the 3-week wave. Short rest (45-60 seconds) between sets. Focus on maximal bar speed off the chest.

**Speed Deadlifts**: 6x1 at 65%, 70%, and 75% of 1RM. Singles allow maximal acceleration without fatigue compromising speed on later reps.

**Accessories**: 3-4 exercises per session at 3-4 sets of 8-15 reps using double progression. Accessories are where you build muscle mass to support the main lifts.

## Progressive Overload

**Max Effort days**: Progression happens by rotating to a new variation every 3 weeks. When you return to a variation (after 6+ weeks), you attempt to beat your previous best. The 1RM for each lift increases by 5lb (upper) or 10lb (lower) at the end of each 3-week wave if you successfully complete your top sets.

**Dynamic Effort days**: Weight increases each week within the 3-week wave (70% → 75% → 80% for squat; 55% → 60% → 65% for bench). After week 3, the wave resets back to week 1 percentages, but your 1RM may have increased from max effort progress.

**Accessories**: Double progression — increase reps from the low end of the range to the high end, then add weight and reset reps. For example, [{Skullcrusher}] starts at 3x8; once you can do 3x12, add 5lb and go back to 3x8.

**Stalling**: If you fail a max effort attempt, the weight stays the same. The variation rotation means you won't attempt the same lift again for several weeks, giving time for adaptation. If dynamic effort bar speed degrades, reduce weight by 5-10% and rebuild.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

The Conjugate Method is designed to be run indefinitely — it's a training system, not a peaking program. Many lifters at Westside Barbell have used it for years or decades. If you need to peak for a meet, add a 2-3 week taper where you reduce volume but maintain intensity.

Signs to consider a change: if you've been running it for 6+ months and your maxes have stalled despite trying different variations, you may benefit from a volume block program like [GZCL: Jacked & Tan 2.0](/programs/gzcl-jacked-and-tan-2) or [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) before returning to conjugate training.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, plates, and squat rack with safety pins
- Flat bench and adjustable incline bench
- A box or bench for [{Box Squat}] (a flat bench works)
- Cable machine (for [{Face Pull}], [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Triceps Pushdown}], [{Seated Row}])
- Dumbbells (for [{Bent Over One Arm Row}])

If you don't have a cable machine, substitute [{Face Pull}] with [{Reverse Fly}], [{Lat Pulldown}] with [{Chin Up}], [{Triceps Pushdown}] with [{Skullcrusher}], and [{Seated Row}] with [{Bent Over Row}].

## Rest Times

- **Max Effort main lift**: 3-5 minutes between working sets as you build up to your top set
- **Dynamic Effort main lifts**: 45-60 seconds between sets — this density is critical for developing rate of force development
- **Accessories**: 60-90 seconds between sets

## How to Pick Starting Weights

- **Max Effort days**: Set your 1RM for [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Deadlift}] in the app. For ME variations, work up based on feel — start with the bar, add weight in moderate jumps (10-15% of estimated max per jump), and take smaller jumps as you approach your max. Your top set should be an all-out 1-3 reps.
- **Dynamic Effort days**: Based on percentages of your 1RM. If you don't know your 1RM, use the heaviest weight you've done for 3-5 reps and estimate from there.
- **Accessories**: Start conservatively. Pick a weight you could do for 15 reps, then do sets of 8. This leaves room for progression and prevents accessory work from interfering with recovery for main lifts.
- **Common mistake**: Going too heavy on dynamic effort work. If your speed sets take longer than 2-3 seconds per set, the weight is too heavy. Speed is the priority.

## Common Modifications

- **Adding bands/chains**: If you have access to accommodating resistance, reduce bar weight by 20-25% and add that percentage in band/chain tension. This is closer to the original Westside method.
- **3-day variant**: Drop DE Upper and add speed bench sets at the end of ME Upper day. Run ME Lower → ME Upper (with speed bench) → DE Lower.
- **Replacing Box Squat**: If you don't have a box, use pause squats with a 2-second pause at parallel. The goal is the same — eliminate the stretch reflex and build starting strength.
- **More deadlift volume**: Add [{Sumo Deadlift}] or conventional [{Deadlift}] as a T2 movement on ME Lower day if your deadlift is a weak point.
- **Weak lockout**: Add [{Board Press}] or pin press variations on ME Upper day (use [{Bench Press}] with partial ROM in a power rack).
- **Weak off the chest**: Emphasize paused bench and [{Chest Dip}] as accessories on upper body days.

### Is the Westside Conjugate Method good for beginners?

No. The Conjugate Method requires you to auto-regulate max effort attempts, choose appropriate exercise variations for your weak points, and manage fatigue across four demanding sessions per week. Beginners will progress faster on a simpler linear progression program and should have at least 1-2 years of barbell training experience before attempting conjugate training.

### How many days per week is the Westside Conjugate Method?

Four days per week: Max Effort Lower, Max Effort Upper, Dynamic Effort Lower, and Dynamic Effort Upper. The typical schedule is Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday, with at least 72 hours between max effort and dynamic effort sessions for the same body part.

### Do I need bands and chains for the Conjugate Method?

No. This adaptation uses straight weight (no accommodating resistance) and adjusts the dynamic effort percentages upward to compensate. Raw lifters typically use 60-80% of 1RM for speed work versus the 40-60% plus bands/chains used in the original geared Westside template. Bands and chains are beneficial but not required.

### How often should I change exercises on max effort days?

Every 1-3 weeks. This program rotates max effort variations on a 3-week cycle, which is the most common approach. The key principle is that you should never repeat the same variation long enough for your body to accommodate to it. When you return to a variation after 6+ weeks, try to beat your previous best.

### What's the difference between max effort and dynamic effort?

Max effort means working up to the heaviest weight you can lift for 1-3 reps on that day — it develops absolute strength. Dynamic effort means using submaximal weight (55-80% of 1RM) and moving it as fast as possible for multiple sets of low reps — it develops speed-strength and rate of force development. Both qualities are trained every week in the Conjugate Method.

### Can I run the Westside Conjugate Method while cutting?

It's not ideal. Max effort work requires full recovery, and a caloric deficit limits recovery capacity. If you insist, reduce accessory volume (2 exercises instead of 3-4), keep max effort work to triples instead of singles, and accept that you likely won't set PRs. Your main goal on a cut is to maintain strength, not build it.

### How long should a Conjugate Method session take?

Expect 60-90 minutes per session including warmups. Max effort days tend to run longer (75-90 minutes) because working up to a heavy single requires more warmup sets and longer rest periods. Dynamic effort days are faster (60-75 minutes) because the short rest periods between speed sets keep things moving.

### What if I miss a max effort attempt?

It's normal to miss occasionally — that's part of training maximally. If you miss, don't attempt the weight again that day. Record what you achieved, and focus on beating that number next time the variation comes around. Frequent misses (more than once every few weeks) suggest you're overshooting your attempts — leave 1 rep in the tank by working to heavy triples instead of true maxes.
