Jim Wendler's most popular 5/3/1 template for building muscle. Each session pairs the standard 5/3/1 progression on one main barbell lift with 5 sets of 10 reps of the same lift at a lighter weight, then finishes with minimal assistance work. The high-rep supplemental sets drive hypertrophy while the heavy main work maintains and builds strength.

## Origin & Philosophy

Boring But Big (BBB) is a supplemental template for Jim Wendler's [5/3/1 system](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big), published on his blog and later expanded in his books *Beyond 5/3/1* and *5/3/1 Forever*. Wendler — a former Westside Barbell trainee who squatted 1,000 lbs — created BBB to add a straightforward hypertrophy component to 5/3/1.

The philosophy is brutally simple: after your heavy main work, hammer the same movement pattern with high-rep sets at moderate weight. No complicated exercise selection, no fancy periodization for accessories. Just pick up the bar and do 50 reps. The name is literal — it's boring, but it works.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (1-3 years). You need solid technique on [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}] because you'll be doing these lifts for 8 total sets each session, including high-rep sets where form tends to break down.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy with strength maintenance. The 5/3/1 sets keep you strong; the 5x10 sets build muscle.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance with high caloric intake. The 5x10 sets create significant fatigue and demand good recovery. Not recommended for cutting — if you're in a caloric deficit, use a lower-volume template like First Set Last (FSL).

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- One of the best hypertrophy programs for a home gym — the main work only requires a barbell, squat rack, bench, and pull-up bar. Accessories only need a pair of dumbbells.
- Dead simple to follow — just the main lift twice (heavy then light), plus 2 accessories per session
- 50 reps of each main lift per session builds muscle in the exact movement patterns you're trying to get stronger at
- AMRAP sets on the top set provide auto-regulation — you get immediate feedback on whether your Training Max is appropriate
- Only 4 days per week with no complicated exercise rotation

**Cons**

- The 5x10 [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] sets are brutally fatiguing — expect sessions to run 70-80 minutes including rest between high-rep sets
- Recovery demands are high, especially for lower body days — requires adequate sleep and caloric surplus
- Not appropriate for a cut — the volume is too high to recover from in a caloric deficit

## Program Structure

- **Split**: One main lift per day across 4 days (OHP / Deadlift / Bench / Squat)
- **Periodization**: Weekly undulating — the 5/3/1 top set changes each week (5+ / 3+ / 1+), while the BBB supplemental volume stays constant at 5x10
- **Cycle**: 3 working weeks + 1 deload week = 4-week cycle
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — typically Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri or any 4 days that allow at least one rest day between lower body sessions

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Each day focuses on one of the four main barbell lifts: [{Overhead Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Squat}]. These are the only exercises that follow the 5/3/1 progression and receive BBB supplemental volume.

The BBB supplemental work uses the **same lift** as the main work. Wendler's reasoning: the best way to get better at a lift is to do more of that lift. Doing [{Bench Press}] for 5x10 after your heavy bench work gives you 80 total reps of benching per week (when including warm-ups), which is significantly more practice than most programs provide.

**Assistance work** follows Wendler's push/pull/core template with two exercises per session. Each day pairs one pulling or arm exercise with one arm or core exercise:
- **OHP day**: [{Chin Up}] balances the pressing with vertical pulling, [{Skullcrusher}] adds direct triceps volume
- **Deadlift day**: [{Bicep Curl}] for biceps (deadlifts already train the back), [{Hanging Leg Raise}] for core
- **Bench day**: [{Triceps Extension}] for triceps from a different angle than skullcrushers, [{Hammer Curl}] for biceps and brachialis
- **Squat day**: [{Pull Up}] for back width, [{Ab Wheel}] for anterior core stability

These can be freely swapped for any similar exercise.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Main 5/3/1 work** follows the standard wave. In the original program, percentages are based on a Training Max (TM = 90% of 1RM). In this Liftosaur implementation, percentages are expressed as **% of 1RM directly** (pre-converted from TM), so you just need to set your 1RM:
- **Week 1 (5s)**: 1x5 @ 58%, 1x5 @ 67%, 1x5+ @ 76%
- **Week 2 (3s)**: 1x3 @ 63%, 1x3 @ 72%, 1x3+ @ 81%
- **Week 3 (5/3/1)**: 1x5 @ 67%, 1x3 @ 76%, 1x1+ @ 85%

The final set each week is AMRAP — do as many reps as possible while keeping good bar speed. Stop when the bar slows significantly or form breaks down. Don't grind to absolute failure.

**BBB supplemental work**: 5 sets of 10 reps at 50% of 1RM. This weight should feel manageable for the first 2 sets and challenging by sets 4-5. If you can't complete all 50 reps, the weight is too heavy.

**Deload week**: All sets drop to 36-54% of 1RM with no AMRAP, and BBB volume drops to 40% of 1RM. This recovery week is essential — don't skip it.

**Assistance work**: 5 sets of 10 reps each for one pull and one arm or core exercise. These are done at light-to-moderate effort, not to failure.

## Progressive Overload

After completing each 3-week working cycle (before the deload), increase your 1RM:
- **[{Overhead Press}] and [{Bench Press}]**: +5 lbs
- **[{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}]**: +10 lbs

These increments are fixed and apply to your 1RM, which shifts all percentage-based weights up slightly. The slow progression is by design — Wendler's rule is "start too light" and let the weights build over months.

**When you stall**: If you can't hit the prescribed minimum reps on your AMRAP sets for a full cycle (e.g., getting only 3-4 reps on the 5+ set, or failing the 1+ set entirely), your weights are too heavy. Reduce your 1RM by 10-15% and rebuild.

**Deload**: Every 4th week. Use lighter weights (36-54% of 1RM) and no AMRAP sets. Don't skip deloads — the BBB volume accumulates fatigue that needs periodic dissipation.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run BBB for **3-6 cycles** (12-24 weeks). It's a template you can return to repeatedly — many lifters cycle between BBB and lower-volume templates like FSL or SSL.

**Signs it's time to switch**: You're dreading the 5x10 sets every session (mental burnout), recovery is suffering despite adequate sleep/food, or you want to prioritize absolute strength over hypertrophy.

**Transition to**: **BBB 3-Month Challenge** (ramps BBB weight from 50% to 70% TM over 3 cycles for more advanced lifters), **5/3/1 Building the Monolith** (higher volume, more variety), or **5/3/1 First Set Last** (lower volume, better for cutting or recovery phases). Any 5/3/1 template from *5/3/1 Forever* works as a follow-up.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, squat rack, bench, weight plates, and a pull-up bar for the main lifts and pulling accessories. A pair of dumbbells or an EZ bar for arm isolation work ([{Skullcrusher}], [{Triceps Extension}], [{Bicep Curl}], [{Hammer Curl}]).

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Skullcrusher}] → [{Bench Dip}] or [{Triceps Dip}] (bodyweight, no equipment)
- [{Triceps Extension}] → [{Bench Dip}] or [{Triceps Dip}]
- [{Bicep Curl}] / [{Hammer Curl}] → extra [{Chin Up}] sets (covers biceps without dumbbells)
- [{Ab Wheel}] → [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Plank}]
- [{Hanging Leg Raise}] → [{Ab Wheel}] or [{Flat Leg Raise}]

## Rest Times

- **Main 5/3/1 sets**: **3-5 minutes** between working sets. The AMRAP set may need extra recovery before the BBB work.
- **BBB 5x10 sets**: **60-120 seconds**. Wendler recommends keeping these short to maintain training density. The weight is light enough that you shouldn't need more.
- **Assistance work**: **60-90 seconds**. Can be supersetted (e.g., chin ups between skullcrusher sets) to save time.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

1. For each main lift, estimate or test your **1 Rep Max** (1RM). This Liftosaur program uses 1RM directly — not Training Max.
2. All working percentages are already converted from Wendler's TM-based percentages to 1RM-based percentages (assuming TM = 90% of 1RM). Just set your 1RM and the app calculates everything.

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Work up to a weight you can do for 3-5 clean reps. Use Brzycki's formula: 1RM = weight / (1.0278 - 0.0278 x reps). Or just use the Liftosaur 1RM calculator.

**Common mistake**: Setting your 1RM too high. Wendler's core principle is "start too light." If your AMRAP set on Week 1 (5+ day) only gives you 5 reps, your 1RM is probably inflated — you should be getting 7-8+ reps on that set when properly calibrated.

## Common Modifications

- **BBB 3-Month Challenge**: Ramp the BBB weight across 3 cycles — 50% TM in month 1, 60% TM in month 2, 70% TM in month 3. More challenging but drives greater adaptation. During the challenge, Wendler recommends NOT doing AMRAP on the last 5/3/1 set — just hit the prescribed reps.
- **Opposite-lift BBB**: Instead of doing [{Bench Press}] 5x10 after bench 5/3/1, do [{Overhead Press}] 5x10 (and vice versa). Same for [{Squat}]/[{Deadlift}]. Reduces same-pattern fatigue and adds movement variety. Each lift gets trained 2x/week this way.
- **5s PRO variant** (from *Forever*): Replace the AMRAP sets with straight sets of 5 across all 3 weeks. Reduces CNS fatigue and pairs better with the high BBB volume. Recommended in newer Wendler writings.
- **Add [{Face Pull}]**: 3-5 sets of 15-20 reps on pressing days for shoulder health — the program is pressing-heavy.

<!-- faq -->

### Is 5/3/1 Boring But Big good for beginners?

BBB is an intermediate program — you need 1-3 years of experience and solid technique on squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press. The 5x10 supplemental sets demand good form under fatigue. Start with 5/3/1 for Beginners if you're newer to lifting.

### How many days a week is 5/3/1 Boring But Big?

It's a 4-day program, typically Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Friday. Each day focuses on one main barbell lift (OHP, deadlift, bench press, or squat) followed by 5x10 of the same lift and two assistance exercises.

### What makes Boring But Big different from other 5/3/1 templates?

The defining feature is the 5x10 supplemental sets at 50% of 1RM after your heavy 5/3/1 work. This gives you 50 additional reps of each main lift per session, making it one of the most effective templates for building muscle while maintaining strength.

### How does progression work on 5/3/1 BBB?

After each 3-week working cycle, increase your 1RM by 5 lbs for overhead press and bench press, and 10 lbs for squat and deadlift. Every 4th week is a mandatory deload. The BBB supplemental weight stays at 50% of 1RM throughout.

### Can I run 5/3/1 BBB on a cut?

Not recommended. The 5x10 sets create significant fatigue that requires adequate caloric surplus and sleep to recover from. If you're cutting, use a lower-volume template like 5/3/1 First Set Last (FSL) instead.

### How long should I run 5/3/1 Boring But Big?

Run it for 3-6 cycles (12-24 weeks). Many lifters cycle between BBB and lower-volume templates throughout the year. Move on when you're dreading the 5x10 sets every session, recovery is suffering, or you want to prioritize absolute strength over hypertrophy.
