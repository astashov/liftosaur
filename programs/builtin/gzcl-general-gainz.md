It's the latest Cody program, combining the elements and best parts of other GZCL programs: [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp), [VDIP](/programs/gzcl-vdip), [Jacked & Tan 2.0](/programs/gzcl-jacked-and-tan-2), etc.

Before starting the program, please read [the program explanation on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) first!

GZCL: General Gainz is a weightlifting program based on the **GZCL principle**, created by [Cody Lefever](https://www.gainzfever.com/). The GZCL name comes from his Reddit username - [u/gzcl](https://www.reddit.com/u/gzcl). It's the newest program from Cody, combining the learnings from all other GZCL programs, from [VDIP](/programs/gzcl-vdip) and [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) to [Jacked & Tan 2.0](/programs/gzcl-jacked-and-tan-2).

## GZCL principle

Before diving in, here's some basic terminology:

- **Rep Max**: This refers to the maximum weight you can lift for a given number of reps. For instance, if you can do 5 reps (and no more) with 100 kg, then your 5 rep max is 100 kg. When measuring this, you should not go to full failure, but stop when you can't maintain good form for another rep.

Now, let's talk about exercises. Exercises in GZCL programs are split into **3 tiers**:

- **T1**: These are main compound exercises (e.g., [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}]). These exercises involve the highest intensity (i.e., the largest weights, about **85-100%** of your 2-3 rep max), but with lower volume (fewer reps and sets). Typically, you will perform 10-15 total reps, usually within **1-3 reps** per set.
- **T2**: These are secondary compound exercises (e.g., [{Front Squat}], [{Romanian Deadlift}], [{Incline Bench Press}], etc). These exercises have lower intensity (lower weights), but higher volume (more reps and sets). You should pick exercises that will assist with your T1 exercises. These exercises are performed with **65-85%** of your 2-3 rep max, usually within **5-8 reps** per set.
- **T3**: These are isolation exercises (e.g., [{Leg Press}], [{Seated Leg Curl}], [{Triceps Extension}], [{Lateral Raise}]). These exercises have the lowest intensity (lightest weights), but highest volume (most reps and sets). These are performed with less than **65%** of your 2-3 rep max, usually with **8 or more reps** per set.

A useful rule of thumb is the **1:2:3 rule** - for every rep you perform in T1, do 2 reps in T2, and 3 in T3.

This is a very short description of the GZCL principle. For more information, and more details, I REALLY recommend to read [Cody's blogpost](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html).

## Application of the GZCL Principle to the General Gainz program

### T1 Exercises

The progression is based on 4 actions:

- **Find**: you pick a weight you can do for 3-6 reps (3RM-6RM), make an attempt, and estimate it's complexity. Whether it was easy (RPE 8 - 2 reps in the tank), medium (RPE 9 - 1 rep in the tank), or hard - (RPE 10 - no reps in the tank).
- **Hold**: next time you try to do the **same reps with same weight** (e.g., for a second chance).
- **Push**: next time you try to do **more reps with same weight**, push your limits.
- **Extend**: Do **1-rep sets** after the first 3-6 RM set. The number of sets matches your first RM set. For example, if you did a 5RM, you do 5 additional 1-rep sets with the same weight. You can extend the number of sets up to an additional 3 sets if the first set was easy or medium.

So, initially you do **Find** and **Extend**. In the next workouts, you make a decision - either **Hold** or **Push**, and after that - **Extend** again.

Once you get to 6RM + 6 sets, you can increase the weight.

Rest time is important; otherwise, you can pretty much do the extension sets forever. **3-5** minutes after first set, and **2-3** minutes after extension sets.

### T2 Exercises

Pretty similar to T1 - also have 4 actions with the same meaning:

- **Find**: you pick a weight you can do for 6-10 reps (6RM-10RM), make an attempt, and estimate it's complexity. Whether it was easy (RPE 8 - 2 reps in the tank), medium (RPE 9 - 1 rep in the tank) or hard - (RPE 10 - no reps in the tank).
- **Hold**: next time you try to do the **same reps with same weight** (e.g., for a second chance).
- **Push**: next time you try to do **more reps with same weight**, push your limits.
- **Extend**: Do **half-sets** after the first 6-10 RM set. Your goal is to get 2 times of the reps from the first set, doing sets with half reps of your first set. For example if you did 10RM first set, you want to get **20 reps** total in the extension sets. So, you do **4 sets of 5 reps** (5 = 10 / 2). You can extend the number of sets up to an additional **2 sets** if the first set was easy or medium.

Once you get to 10RM + all extension sets, you can increase the weight.

Rest time is important here too. Rest for **2-4** minutes after the first set, and **1-2** minutes after extension sets.

### T3 Exercises

T3 exercises consist of just 3 sets of AMRAP (or Max Rep Sets - MRS). Keep short rest times between them - **30-90 seconds**.

Again, this is just a brief description, and for full information and details, please read the [original post on Reddit with the GZCL General Gainz application](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/).

Check the interactive playground below to see how the program works, and what the weights/sets/reps look like for each day. You can simulate doing RM, and then singles or half-sets after, etc.

You can run the GZCL: General Gainz program in the Liftosaur app.

<!-- faq -->

### Is GZCL General Gainz good for intermediates?

Yes, General Gainz is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters. It combines elements from all previous GZCL programs ([GZCLP](/programs/gzclp), [VDIP](/programs/gzcl-vdip), [Jacked & Tan 2.0](/programs/gzcl-jacked-and-tan-2)) into one flexible system. You should have at least a year of training experience and be comfortable estimating rep maxes.

### How many days a week is General Gainz?

General Gainz is typically run as a 4-day program, but the framework is flexible enough for 3-6 days per week. Each day has a T1 heavy compound, a T2 moderate compound, and T3 isolation work.

### How does progression work in General Gainz?

Progression uses four actions: Find (test a rep max), Hold (repeat the same weight and reps), Push (try more reps at the same weight), and Extend (do singles or half-sets after the main set). Once you reach 6RM + 6 singles for T1 or 10RM + all extensions for T2, you increase the weight.

### What is the difference between General Gainz and GZCLP?

[GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) uses fixed set/rep schemes with automatic linear progression — you add weight every session. General Gainz is autoregulated — you choose when to push, hold, or extend based on how the weight feels. This makes it more flexible but requires more training experience to manage.

### Can I customize exercises in General Gainz?

Yes, the program is a framework, not a fixed routine. You choose your T1, T2, and T3 exercises based on your goals. T1 should be the main competition lifts, T2 should be variations that support T1, and T3 should be isolation work for weak points.

### How long should I run General Gainz?

General Gainz can be run indefinitely because it's autoregulated. There's no fixed cycle length — you just keep finding, pushing, holding, and extending as appropriate. Many lifters run it for 6+ months at a time.

# Week 1
## Day 1
// **T1**.
// * **Find**: Initially set your 1RM for the exercise, and work up to the first set.
// * **Extend**: Do the same amount of singles (1 rep) as it was your RM, with the same weight. E.g. if you did 4RM, do 4 sets x 1 rep after. You can extend the number of sets up to 3 extra sets (e.g. for 4RM - up to 7 sets x 1 rep max) if 4RM was easy.
// * Next time, you'd either try to do the same number of reps with the same weight (**Hold**), or try to **Push** and do more reps.
// * If you are able to do 6 reps with 6 extensions, the weight will be increased next time

// **T2**.
// * **Find**: Initially set your 1RM for the exercise, and work up to the first set.
// * **Extend**: Do the of "halfes" sets (your RM from the first set / 2) so the volume would be double of your RM. E.g. if you did 10RM, do 4 sets x 5 reps (20 total) after. You can extend the number of sets up to 2 extra sets if 10RM was easy.
// * Next time, you'd either try to do the same number of reps with the same weight (**Hold**), or try to **Push** and do more reps.
// * If you are able to do 10RM with 4 extensions, the weight will be increased next time
