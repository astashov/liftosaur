Bullmastiff is an 18-week base-building strength program that develops foundational strength across all four major barbell lifts, then peaks that strength for new PRs. Created by Alex Bromley of Empire Barbell, it uses Doug Young's auto-regulated progression method where AMRAP sets dictate weekly weight increases, ensuring you train at the right intensity.

## Origin & Philosophy

Bullmastiff was created by Alex Bromley and originally appeared in his book Peak Strength. The program's name reflects its purpose: building a wide, solid base of strength before peaking to new maxes. The core progression method comes from Doug Young, a legendary powerlifter from the 1970s, who used AMRAP sets to auto-regulate load increases. For every extra rep you hit on your AMRAP set, you add approximately 1% of your 1RM the following week. This ensures you're always training at an appropriate intensity rather than forcing linear jumps that lead to early stalls.

The philosophy is simple: develop work capacity and muscle mass through moderate-intensity volume in the base phase, then convert that foundation into peak strength. Think of it as building a pyramid - the wider the base, the higher the peak you can achieve.

## Who It's For

Bullmastiff is designed for intermediate lifters with 6+ months of consistent training. You should be comfortable with the competition lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press) and have a realistic estimate of your 1RM for each. The program suits those who:

- Want to build both strength and muscle over 18 weeks
- Can commit to 4 training days per week
- Prefer auto-regulated progression over rigid percentage schemes
- Are preparing for a strength peak (competition, PR testing, or just hitting new maxes)

It works well on a bulk or maintenance calories. You can run it on a cut, but recovery may be compromised during the higher-volume base phase. Bromley notes that some lifters, especially those who respond better to higher pressing frequency, may need to add extra pressing volume.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Auto-regulated progression prevents early stalls and ensures appropriate intensity week-to-week
- High frequency (2x/week per lift) builds technique rapidly for intermediate lifters
- Base phase emphasizes work capacity and hypertrophy, creating a foundation for strength gains
- Structured peak phase methodically brings you to new 1RMs
- Includes developmental variations and accessories for balanced development
- Clear 18-week timeline with defined phases

**Cons:**
- Sessions take 60-90 minutes due to main lift + developmental lift + accessories
- Some lifters may need extra pressing volume (Bromley acknowledges feedback about slower bench progress)
- Requires accurate 1RM estimates to start at correct intensities
- Zero direct arm isolation in the template (can be added as extra accessory work)
- Not ideal for beginners who need simpler progression schemes
- 18-week commitment may feel long for those wanting faster cycles

## Program Structure

Bullmastiff runs 18 weeks total, split into two 9-week phases:

**Base Phase (Weeks 1-9):** Three 3-week waves building work capacity through moderate intensity (65-75%) with higher reps (4-6). Each wave increases both volume (more sets) and intensity slightly. The focus is muscle growth, work capacity, and technique refinement.

**Peak Phase (Weeks 10-18):** Three 3-week waves progressing from 80% to 90% with lower reps (1-3). Volume decreases as intensity climbs, allowing you to express the strength built during the base phase. The final wave (weeks 16-18) removes accessories entirely to maximize recovery for heavy singles.

The split is a 4-day upper/lower hybrid:
- Day 1: Squat (main) + Deadlift variation (developmental) + Lower accessories
- Day 2: Bench Press (main) + Overhead Press variation (developmental) + Upper accessories
- Day 3: Deadlift (main) + Squat variation (developmental) + Lower accessories
- Day 4: Overhead Press (main) + Bench variation (developmental) + Upper accessories

Each main lift is trained twice per week: once as the primary movement, once as a developmental (lighter) variation on the opposite day. This provides frequent practice without excessive fatigue.

The program uses wave periodization within each 3-week wave: intensity and volume both climb week-to-week, then drop back to start the next wave at a higher baseline than the previous wave began.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Main Lifts:** [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}]. These are trained as written - competition-style barbell movements. No substitutions recommended unless injury requires it.

**Developmental Lifts:** These are variations of the opposite main lift, programmed at RPE 6-8 for moderate volume. The purpose is to address weak points and add training stimulus without interfering with main lift recovery. Examples:
- Squat day → [{Romanian Deadlift}] or [{Sumo Deadlift}]
- Bench day → [{Overhead Press, Dumbbell}] or [{Push Press}]
- Deadlift day → [{Front Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]
- Overhead Press day → [{Incline Bench Press}] or [{Bench Press Close Grip}]

Choose variations that target your weak points. If your lockout is weak on deadlift, use rack pulls. If you struggle out of the hole on squats, use pause squats or front squats.

**Accessory Work:** High-rep bodybuilding movements (12-15 reps) to build muscle and work capacity. The template includes:
- Lower days: [{Bent Over Row}] (back), [{Leg Curl}] (hamstrings), [{Hanging Leg Raise}] (abs)
- Upper days: [{Triceps Extension, Cable}] (triceps), [{Bicep Curl, Dumbbell}] (biceps), [{Face Pull}] (rear delts/rotator cuff)

These can be swapped for similar exercises. The key is hitting the movement pattern (horizontal pull, knee flexion, elbow flexion, etc.) with sufficient volume to drive growth.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Base Phase Main Lifts:**
- Wave 1 (Weeks 1-3): 4x6+ @ 65% (AMRAP last set)
- Wave 2 (Weeks 4-6): 5x5+ @ 70% (AMRAP last set)
- Wave 3 (Weeks 7-9): 6x4+ @ 75% (AMRAP last set)

**Peak Phase Main Lifts:**
- Wave 1 (Weeks 10-12): 5x3+ @ 80% (AMRAP last set)
- Wave 2 (Weeks 13-15): 5x2+ @ 85% (AMRAP last set)
- Wave 3 (Weeks 16-18): 5x1+ @ 90% (AMRAP last set)

The AMRAP sets are critical - push hard but don't go to total failure. Leave 1 rep in the tank. The extra reps determine your weight increase for the next week.

**Developmental Lifts:**
- Base Phase: Start at RPE 6, progress to RPE 8 over 3 weeks. Rep ranges vary (3x8, 4x10, 5x12) depending on the wave.
- Peak Phase: 4x6 @ RPE 6 progressing to 2x4 @ RPE 8 over 3 weeks per wave. Higher intensity, lower volume.

**Accessories:**
- Base Phase: 2-5 sets of 12-15 reps. Add sets each week within a wave. Focus on pump and volume, not load.
- Peak Phase Waves 1-2: 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps.
- Peak Phase Wave 3: No accessories - all energy goes to heavy singles.

The base phase uses hypertrophy rep ranges (4-6 reps on main lifts, 8-15 on accessories) to build muscle. The peak phase shifts to strength rep ranges (1-3 reps) to express that muscle as maximal force.

## Progressive Overload

Bullmastiff uses Doug Young's auto-regulated progression for main lifts:

**For every extra rep on your AMRAP set, add 1% of your 1RM the following week.**

Example: Your squat 1RM is 400lb. Week 1 calls for 4x6+ @ 65% = 260lb. On your AMRAP set, you hit 10 reps (4 extra reps). For Week 2, add 4% of 400lb = 16lb. New weight: 276lb.

This method ensures you're always training at the right intensity. If you're weak or fatigued, you hit fewer extra reps and the load increases conservatively. If you're strong and recovered, you hit many extra reps and jump up faster. It's smarter than blind linear progression.

**Developmental lifts** progress via RPE. Start at RPE 6 in Week 1, hit RPE 7 in Week 2, RPE 8 in Week 3. Add weight only when the prescribed RPE feels easy. If RPE 6 feels like RPE 7, keep the weight the same until it feels like a true RPE 6 before adding load.

**Accessories** progress by adding reps or sets. If you hit the top of the rep range (15 reps) on all sets, add 5-10lb. But don't chase load - accessories are about volume and muscle stimulus, not PRs.

**Deloads:** None programmed. The wave structure provides a mini-reset every 3 weeks when you drop back to lower volume/intensity at the start of the next wave. If you feel run down, take a light week or skip a session rather than grinding through.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run Bullmastiff for the full 18 weeks. It's designed as a complete cycle: base + peak. Don't skip the base phase thinking you'll just do the peak phase - the base phase builds the work capacity and muscle that allows the peak phase to succeed.

After finishing, you have several options:

**Option 1:** Test your new 1RMs during Week 19, take a deload week, then run another block of Bullmastiff with updated 1RMs. This works well if you made significant progress and want to repeat the process.

**Option 2:** Transition to a different periodization style. Since Bullmastiff is a linear wave program, switching to DUP (daily undulating periodization) or block periodization provides a new stimulus. Programs like [GZCL: Jacked & Tan 2.0](/programs/gzcl-jacked-and-tan-2) or conjugate-style programming work well.

**Option 3:** Take a volume accumulation block. After 18 weeks of structured strength work, running 4-6 weeks of hypertrophy-focused training (higher reps, more accessories, less intensity) allows fatigue to dissipate while building more muscle for the next strength phase.

**Option 4:** If you're competing in powerlifting, run a meet prep program that includes openers, attempts, and peaking strategies. Bullmastiff gets you strong but doesn't teach meet-specific skills.

Don't immediately jump into another aggressive strength program without some recovery. Your joints and CNS need a break after 18 weeks of progressive overload.

## Equipment Needed

**Required:**
- Barbell, squat rack, bench
- Plates covering 65-90%+ of your 1RM across all lifts
- Pull-up bar or lat pulldown station (for back accessories)

**Developmental lifts** may require dumbbells for press variations, or specific equipment like a safety squat bar for squat variations. Most gyms have what you need. If you train at home and lack certain equipment, substitute freely:
- No dumbbells for overhead press → use [{Push Press}] or [{Behind The Neck Press}]
- No front squat equipment → use [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Goblet Squat}]
- No machine for leg curls → use [{Romanian Deadlift}] or [{Nordic Hamstring Curl}]

**Accessories** are flexible. If the template calls for cable triceps extensions and you only have dumbbells, use [{Triceps Extension, Dumbbell}]. If you don't have a face pull station, use [{Bent Over Rear Delt Raise}]. The key is hitting the muscle group, not the exact exercise.

## Rest Times

**Main Lifts:** 3-5 minutes between sets. These are your priority. Rest as long as needed to hit your target reps with good form. Don't rush sets because you're watching the clock.

**Developmental Lifts:** 2-3 minutes. These are moderate intensity (RPE 6-8), so you don't need as much recovery. But don't superset them with other work - give them dedicated rest.

**Accessories:** 60-90 seconds. These are high-rep pump work. Short rest keeps the session moving and increases metabolic stress.

During the base phase, sessions will take 60-90 minutes due to the high volume. In the peak phase, sessions get shorter (45-75 minutes) as volume drops and accessories are reduced or eliminated.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

You need realistic 1RM estimates for all four lifts. If you don't know your 1RM:

**Option 1:** Test it. Take a day, warm up thoroughly, and work up to a heavy single. Don't grind it - if you're not sure you can hit it, stop one attempt before. It's better to start 5-10lb too light than too heavy.

**Option 2:** Estimate from a recent rep max. If you hit 315lb for 5 reps on squat, use an online calculator (e.g., search "1RM calculator") to estimate your 1RM. For a 5RM, multiply by roughly 1.15. So 315 x 1.15 = 362lb estimated 1RM.

**Option 3:** Use your most recent heavy triple (3RM) and multiply by 1.08. Or use your best set of 5 in recent training and multiply by 1.12-1.15.

**Critical: Start conservative.** If your estimated 1RM is 400lb but you're not confident, use 385lb. Week 1 @ 65% should feel comfortably submaximal. You should hit 8-10 reps on the AMRAP set without grinding. If you only hit 6-7 reps, your 1RM is probably too high.

**Common mistake:** Starting too heavy. Lifters see "65%" and think it'll be easy, so they inflate their 1RM. Then Week 1 feels like RPE 9, and by Week 9 @ 75%, they're grinding every set. The program works best when Week 1 is truly easy (RPE 6-7) and the difficulty ramps smoothly.

**For developmental lifts:** Start light. Pick a weight where RPE 6 truly feels like RPE 6 (4 reps left in the tank). You'll add weight over 3 weeks, so there's no need to start heavy.

**For accessories:** Pick a weight where you can hit 12-15 reps with good form and a pump. If you're grinding rep 12, it's too heavy. These aren't PR attempts.

## Common Modifications

**3-Day Version:** Combine days. Do Day 1 + Day 2 on Monday, Day 3 + Day 4 on Wednesday, and a lighter "assistance day" on Friday with just accessories and developmental lifts. This is extremely long per session (2+ hours) and not recommended unless you have no other option.

**5-Day Version:** Add a fifth "pump day" for arms, shoulders, or weak points. This works well for lifters who feel they need more pressing volume or direct arm work. Keep it light (RPE 6-7, high reps) so it doesn't interfere with main sessions.

**Exercise Substitutions:**
- Squat → can't substitute without fundamentally changing the program, but you can use variations (high bar, low bar, safety squat bar).
- Deadlift → [{Trap Bar Deadlift}] works if conventional deadlifts hurt your back, but your carryover to conventional will be less.
- Bench Press → if shoulder issues prevent flat benching, use [{Incline Bench Press}] or [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}]. Acknowledge this changes the program's intent.
- Overhead Press → if you lack mobility, use [{Push Press}] or [{Overhead Press, Dumbbell}].

**Adding Accessories:** The template is minimalist. Many lifters add:
- Direct ab work (planks, ab wheel, weighted crunches) on lower days
- Extra biceps work (hammer curls, preacher curls) on upper days
- Calf raises if lower body development is a priority
- Face pulls or band pull-aparts daily for shoulder health

Keep added work in the 8-15 rep range and don't let it interfere with main lifts. If your bench press is suffering because you did 10 sets of triceps work, you added too much.

**Reduced Volume:** If 60-90 minute sessions don't fit your schedule, cut 1-2 accessory exercises per day. The main and developmental lifts are non-negotiable, but you can survive with less accessory volume.

### Is Bullmastiff good for beginners?

No. Bullmastiff is designed for intermediate lifters with 6+ months of consistent training experience. Beginners need simpler progression schemes like linear progression on 3-day programs. Try [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) or [Basic Beginner](/programs/basicBeginner) first, then move to Bullmastiff once you're stalling on those programs.

### How many days per week is Bullmastiff?

Bullmastiff is a 4-day program. Each main lift (squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press) is trained twice per week: once as the primary movement, once as a lighter variation on the opposite day. A typical schedule is Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Friday or Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday.

### How long should I run Bullmastiff?

Run the full 18 weeks: 9-week base phase followed by 9-week peak phase. Don't skip the base phase. After completing the cycle, test your new 1RMs, take a deload week, then either repeat Bullmastiff with updated maxes or transition to a different training style for variety.

### What do I do if I miss reps on the AMRAP set?

If you hit fewer reps than prescribed on the AMRAP set (e.g., only 5 reps on a 6+ set), keep the weight the same next week or reduce by 5-10lb. The auto-regulation works both ways: extra reps add weight, missing reps mean you don't increase or you reduce slightly. Don't force jumps.

### Can I run Bullmastiff while cutting?

You can, but recovery will be harder, especially during the high-volume base phase. The peak phase (weeks 10-18) is more manageable on a cut since volume is lower. If you're cutting, be conservative with your starting 1RMs and don't push AMRAP sets to total failure - leave 2 reps in the tank instead of 1.

### Why am I not making progress on bench press in Bullmastiff?

Alex Bromley acknowledges that some lifters experience slower bench progress because pressing movements use smaller muscle groups and shorter ranges of motion, requiring more frequent stimulus than squats or deadlifts. If this happens, add extra pressing volume: an additional pressing movement (incline bench, dips, etc.) on one of the lower days, or increase the developmental pressing work from 3-4 sets to 5-6 sets.

### What is the Doug Young progression method?

Doug Young was a legendary 1970s powerlifter who used AMRAP sets to auto-regulate load. For every extra rep you hit beyond the prescribed reps, you add approximately 1% of your 1RM the next week. This ensures you're always training at an appropriate intensity based on your current performance, rather than forcing fixed jumps that may be too aggressive or too conservative.

### Can I add more accessory exercises to Bullmastiff?

Yes. The template is minimalist on accessories. Common additions include extra ab work, more bicep/tricep isolation, calf raises, or rear delt work. Keep added accessories in the 8-15 rep range and don't let them interfere with recovery for main lifts. If your squat performance drops because you added too many leg accessories, scale back.
