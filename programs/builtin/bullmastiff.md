An 18-week program that builds a broad strength base across [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], and [{Overhead Press}] through high-volume wave progression (9 weeks), then peaks that strength through lower-volume, higher-intensity waves (9 weeks). Each main lift is trained twice per week — once as a primary movement and once as a developmental variation on the opposite day. AMRAP sets autoregulate weekly progression.

## Origin & Philosophy

Bullmastiff was created by Alex Bromley at [Empire Barbell](https://empire-barbell.com/2022/08/09/complete-breakdown-of-bullmastiff-plus-free-pdf-of-the-program/) as a practical implementation of his book *Base Strength*. The program is named after the dog breed known for its powerful build and endurance — a fitting metaphor for the training approach.

The philosophy centers on Doug Young's training methodology from the 1970s: build a wide strength base across all four main lifts, then peak that base to hit bigger maxes. Young famously trained with submaximal weights for high volume, using AMRAP sets to autoregulate progression. Bromley adds substantial bodybuilding-style accessory work, subscribing to Young's belief that aesthetics support performance.

The two-phase structure deliberately separates base building (weeks 1-9) from peaking (weeks 10-18). The base phase accumulates volume and work capacity. The peak phase reduces volume, increases intensity, and drives toward new 1RMs.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (1+ years). You need solid technique on all four barbell lifts and the work capacity to handle 2 heavy compound lifts plus accessories in a single 75-90 minute session.
- **Primary goal**: Strength with significant hypertrophy from the base phase volume. The first 9 weeks build muscle; the last 9 weeks convert that muscle into peak strength.
- **Best suited for**: Lifters who've exhausted linear progression and want a structured peaking program. Works well as a meet prep cycle for powerlifters (substitute comp lifts as needed).
- **Prerequisites**: Comfortable with RPE-based training for accessories. You should be able to judge when a set is RPE 6 (3-4 reps left in the tank) vs RPE 8 (2 reps left).

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- All four main lifts trained 2x/week builds technique and strength faster than once-per-week programs
- AMRAP autoregulation prevents stalling — add 1% of 1RM per extra rep, so progression scales with performance
- Wave loading (3-week cycles) manages fatigue naturally — intensity and volume rise for 3 weeks, then reset
- Base phase volume (up to 6 sets of 4+ reps at 75%) drives significant muscle growth alongside strength
- Developmental lifts on opposite days provide practice volume without interfering with main lift recovery

**Cons**

- Sessions routinely take 75-90 minutes due to multiple heavy compound lifts plus 3-5 accessory exercises per day
- 18-week commitment is long — you need discipline to finish the full base and peak phases
- RPE-based accessory progression requires experience estimating effort; beginners may under- or overshoot
- No formal deload weeks — if you need one, you'll have to program it yourself (drop to Week 1 weights as a deload)

## Program Structure

- **Split**: 4-day rotation with each main lift appearing as a primary lift one day and as a developmental/variation lift on another day
- **Periodization**: Block periodization with two distinct 9-week phases. Base phase uses moderate intensity (65-75%) with ascending volume. Peak phase uses high intensity (80-90%) with descending volume.
- **Schedule**: Day 1 [{Squat}] focus, Day 2 [{Bench Press}] focus, Day 3 [{Deadlift}] focus, Day 4 [{Overhead Press}] focus. Can be run on any 4 days per week that allow recovery.
- **Wave structure**: Each 3-week wave increases either sets or intensity, then the next wave starts with different loading parameters. Base phase: 4x6 → 5x5 → 6x4. Peak phase: 5x3 → 3x2 → 1x1 (with decreasing set counts).

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Each day pairs a **main lift** with a **developmental lift** from the opposite movement pattern, plus accessories.

**Day 1 — Squat focus**
- Main: [{Squat}] (percentage-based progression)
- Developmental: Deadlift variation (Romanian, stiff-leg, or paused — RPE-based, higher reps)
- Accessories: [{Bent Over Row}], [{Leg Curl}], [{Leg Extension}], [{Cable Crunch}]

**Day 2 — Bench Press focus**
- Main: [{Bench Press}] (percentage-based)
- Developmental: OHP variation (overhead pressing at RPE, moderate reps)
- Accessories: [{Triceps Extension}], [{Bicep Curl}], [{Rear Delt Fly, Dumbbell}]

**Day 3 — Deadlift focus**
- Main: [{Deadlift}] (percentage-based)
- Developmental: Squat variation (front squat, box squat, or paused — RPE-based)
- Accessories: [{Lat Pulldown}], [{Leg Curl}], [{Leg Extension}], [{Cable Crunch}]

**Day 4 — Overhead Press focus**
- Main: [{Overhead Press}] (percentage-based)
- Developmental: Bench variation (close-grip, spoto press, or floor press — RPE-based)
- Accessories: [{Triceps Extension}], [{Bicep Curl}], [{Rear Delt Fly, Dumbbell}]

The main lift gets heavy, structured progression. The developmental lift provides extra practice volume on the opposite movement pattern without interfering with recovery — deadlift variations on squat day hit similar muscles but don't directly compete with squat recovery.

**Accessories** follow a bodybuilding approach with ascending volume across 3-week waves. Back work (rows, pulldowns), leg isolation (curls, extensions), and core work fill gaps left by the main lifts.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Base Phase Main Lifts** (Weeks 1-9):
- Wave 1 (Weeks 1-3): 4 sets of 6+ reps at 65% → 65% → 65%
- Wave 2 (Weeks 4-6): 5 sets of 5+ reps at 70% → 70% → 70%
- Wave 3 (Weeks 7-9): 6 sets of 4+ reps at 75% → 75% → 75%

The `+` indicates AMRAP on the final set each session. Intensity stays constant within each wave; sets increase week-to-week.

**Peak Phase Main Lifts** (Weeks 10-18):
- Wave 1 (Weeks 10-12): 5/3/1 sets of 3+ reps at 80% → 80% → 80%
- Wave 2 (Weeks 13-15): 5/3/1 sets of 2+ reps at 85% → 85% → 85%
- Wave 3 (Weeks 16-18): 5/3/1 sets of 1+ reps at 90% → 90% → 90%

Sets *decrease* across weeks within each wave (5 sets → 3 sets → 1 set) as intensity stays constant. The final set is AMRAP.

**Developmental Lifts** (all 18 weeks):
- Base Wave 1: 3/4/5 sets of 12 reps at RPE 6/7/8
- Base Wave 2: 3/4/5 sets of 10 reps at RPE 6/7/8
- Base Wave 3: 3/4/5 sets of 8 reps at RPE 6/6/6
- Peak Wave 1: 4/3/2 sets of 6 reps at RPE 6/7/8
- Peak Wave 2: 4/3/2 sets of 5 reps at RPE 6/7/8
- Peak Wave 3: 4/3/2 sets of 4 reps at RPE 6/7/8

Sets ascend in base phase, descend in peak phase. RPE climbs within each wave (6 → 7 → 8) as work capacity builds.

**Accessories**:
- Base Wave 1: 2/3/4 sets of 12-15 reps
- Base Waves 2-3: 3/4/5 sets of 8-12 reps
- Peak Waves 1-2: 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps
- Peak Wave 3: Minimal accessory work (2-3 sets) as peak lifts become primary focus

## Progressive Overload

**Main lifts** progress via AMRAP autoregulation: For every rep completed *beyond* the prescribed minimum on the AMRAP set, add **1% of your 1RM** to the following week's weight.

Example: Week 1 calls for 4x6+ at 65%. Your 1RM is 300 lb, so working weight is 195 lb. On the final set, you hit 10 reps (4 reps over the minimum of 6). Next week, add 4% of 300 lb = 12 lb. Week 2 weight becomes 207 lb.

This autoregulation naturally scales progression to your performance. Overshoot the reps and you'll catch up quickly. Barely hit the minimum and progression slows appropriately.

**Developmental lifts** progress by feel using RPE: When you can complete all prescribed sets at the target RPE with good form, add 5-10 lb the following week. If you can't hit the RPE target (e.g., RPE 6 feels like RPE 8), reduce weight by 5-10%.

**Accessories** use double progression: increase reps within the range (8 → 12 or 12 → 15), then add 5 lb and drop back to the bottom of the range.

**Stalling**: If you fail to hit the minimum prescribed reps on a main lift AMRAP, don't increase weight the following week. If you fail 2-3 weeks in a row, reduce your 1RM by 5-10% and rebuild.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the full **18 weeks** without modification. The program is designed as a complete cycle — base phase builds capacity, peak phase converts that capacity to strength. Stopping after 9 weeks wastes the peaking phase.

After completing all 18 weeks, take a **deload week** (50-60% intensity, no AMRAP sets, 2-3 sets per exercise). Then test your new 1RMs if desired, or roll into another program.

**What next**: If you enjoyed the structure, run Bullmastiff again with updated 1RMs. Otherwise, transition to a different periodization style like [5/3/1 Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) (submaximal, higher volume), [nSuns LP](/programs/nsuns) (aggressive linear progression), or another intermediate program. Bromley also recommends his other programs like **Base Strength** variations or **Peak Strength**.

## Equipment Needed

Barbell, squat rack, flat bench, weight plates. A cable machine or bands for [{Triceps Extension}], [{Cable Crunch}], and [{Lat Pulldown}]. Dumbbells for [{Rear Delt Fly, Dumbbell}] and [{Bicep Curl}].

**Home gym substitutions** (if no cable machine):
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}] (bodyweight)
- [{Triceps Extension}] → [{Skullcrusher}] or [{Bench Dip}]
- [{Cable Crunch}] → [{Ab Wheel}] or [{Hanging Leg Raise}]
- [{Leg Extension}] / [{Leg Curl}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] and [{Nordic Curl}] (if you have a way to anchor your feet)

Developmental lifts can be swapped based on equipment: [{Romanian Deadlift}] or [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] instead of trap bar variations, [{Front Squat}] or [{Box Squat}] for squat variations, [{Bench Press Close Grip}] for bench variations.

## Rest Times

- **Main lifts**: **3-5 minutes** between working sets in base phase, **4-6 minutes** in peak phase (weeks 10-18). Take as much time as needed after AMRAP sets.
- **Developmental lifts**: **90-120 seconds**. The RPE targets are moderate (RPE 6-8), so rest doesn't need to be excessive.
- **Accessories**: **60-90 seconds**. Can superset opposing muscle groups (e.g., biceps and triceps) to save time.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Set your **1 Rep Max** for each of the four main lifts ([{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}]) in the app. All main lift percentages are calculated from these.

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Work up to a weight you can lift for 3-5 reps with good form. Use an online 1RM calculator (or the one built into Liftosaur) to estimate your max.

**Calibration check**: On Week 1, the first main lift AMRAP is at 65% for 4x6+. You should be able to hit **8-10 reps** on that AMRAP set. If you can only hit 6-7 reps, your 1RM is set too high — reduce by 5-10%. If you hit 12+ reps, it's set too low.

**Developmental lifts**: Start conservatively — pick a weight that feels like RPE 6 (you could do 3-4 more reps) on the first week. It's better to start light and build up.

**Accessories**: Use the default weights provided and adjust by feel. These should feel moderately challenging but not limit your recovery for the main lifts.

## Common Modifications

- **Extra frequency for bench**: Bromley notes that bench press can lag behind other lifts for some people. If your bench isn't progressing, add an extra light bench session (3x8 at 60-65%) on Day 3 after deadlifts.
- **Exercise substitutions**: Swap developmental lift variations based on equipment or preference. Use [{Romanian Deadlift}] or [{Rack Pull}] instead of trap bar deadlifts, [{Front Squat}] or [{Pause Squat}] instead of box squats, [{Bench Press Close Grip}] or [{Floor Press}] for bench variations.
- **Accessory selection**: Bromley recommends keeping back work (rows, pulldowns) and leg work (curls, extensions) but adjusting arm and core accessories based on individual needs. Add [{Face Pull}] if shoulder health is a concern.
- **Deload insertion**: No deloads are programmed, but if you're dragging by Week 6 or 15, insert a deload week (Week 1 weights, no AMRAP, 2-3 sets per exercise).
- **Meet prep adaptation**: Powerlifters can replace developmental lifts with comp-specific variations (comp squat, comp bench, comp deadlift paused variants) in the peak phase.

### Who is Bullmastiff for?

Bullmastiff is best for intermediate to advanced lifters with at least 1 year of consistent training experience. You need solid technique on squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press, plus the work capacity to handle 75-90 minute sessions with multiple heavy compound lifts and accessories.

### How many days per week is Bullmastiff?

Bullmastiff is a 4-day program. Each day focuses on one main lift (squat, bench, deadlift, or overhead press) followed by a developmental lift from the opposite movement pattern, then accessories.

### How long should I run Bullmastiff?

Run the full 18 weeks without modification. The program is designed as a complete cycle with a 9-week base phase that builds work capacity and a 9-week peak phase that converts that capacity into peak strength. Stopping early wastes the peaking benefits.

### How does progression work on Bullmastiff?

Main lifts progress via AMRAP autoregulation. For every rep you complete beyond the prescribed minimum on the final AMRAP set, add 1% of your 1RM to next week's weight. If you hit 10 reps on a 6+ AMRAP, you add 4% to your working weight the following week.

### What's the difference between the base phase and peak phase?

The base phase (weeks 1-9) uses moderate intensity (65-75%) with higher volume (4-6 sets of 4-6 reps) to build work capacity and muscle. The peak phase (weeks 10-18) uses high intensity (80-90%) with lower volume (1-5 sets of 1-3 reps) to peak strength for new 1RMs.

### How long do Bullmastiff workouts take?

Sessions typically take 75-90 minutes. Main lifts require 3-5 minute rest periods in the base phase and 4-6 minutes in the peak phase. Developmental lifts take 90-120 seconds rest. Accessories can be supersetted to save time.

### Can I run Bullmastiff on a cut?

The base phase (weeks 1-9) is very demanding with high volume, so it's best run on a maintenance or slight surplus. The peak phase (weeks 10-18) has lower volume and can be run on a moderate cut. If cutting the whole time, expect slower progression and consider extending rest times.

### What if my bench press isn't progressing as fast as my other lifts?

Alex Bromley recommends adding an extra light bench session (3x8 at 60-65%) on Day 3 after deadlifts if your bench is lagging. You can also increase the developmental bench variation volume on Day 4.
