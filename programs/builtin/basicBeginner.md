The go-to starting program from the r/Fitness wiki. Three days per week, two alternating workouts, six barbell movements. Every set scheme is the same: 2 straight sets of 5, then one all-out AMRAP set. Add weight each session, deload 10% when you stall, and move on after 3 months.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Basic Beginner Routine (BBR) is the primary recommended beginner program on the [r/Fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/) — one of the largest fitness communities on the internet.

The design philosophy is "minimum effective dose": do the fewest exercises that cover all major movement patterns, make progress every session via simple linear weight increases, and build the gym habit without overthinking. It's intentionally bare-bones so beginners can focus on learning form rather than managing a complex program.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Total beginners or lifters returning after a long layoff
- **Goal**: Learn the barbell lifts, build foundational strength, establish a training habit
- **Works on any diet**: Beginners gain strength even on a caloric deficit

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Only 3 exercises per session — you're in and out in 30-45 minutes
- AMRAP last sets auto-regulate intensity and give you a measurable progress indicator beyond just weight on the bar
- Every major movement pattern trained 3 times every 2 weeks — lots of technique practice
- Accelerated progression (double the jump if you hit 10+ AMRAP reps) keeps early weeks from being boring

**Cons**

- Zero direct arm, shoulder, or core isolation — add your own if you care about those
- Only 9 working sets per session — you'll outgrow this volume within 2-3 months
- 2.5lb upper body jumps require microplates (1.25lb each side), which most gyms don't have — you can use 5lb increments instead, but expect more frequent deloads
- No programmed accessories — the base program is genuinely just 3 lifts per day

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, A/B alternating
- **Frequency**: 3 days per week with at least 1 rest day between sessions
- **Rotation**: Week 1 = A/B/A, Week 2 = B/A/B, repeat
- **Session length**: 30-45 minutes
- **Duration**: Up to 3 months, then transition to a bigger program

A typical week on Monday/Wednesday/Friday:

| Monday | Wednesday | Friday |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Workout A | Workout B | Workout A |

The following week flips: B/A/B.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Each workout has one pull, one push, and one lower body compound. This covers every major muscle group every session.

**Workout A**: [{Bent Over Row}] (horizontal pull) → [{Bench Press}] (horizontal push) → [{Squat}] (quad-dominant lower). Rows before bench can help "warm up" the upper back and improve bench press positioning.

**Workout B**: [{Chin Up}] (vertical pull) → [{Overhead Press}] (vertical push) → [{Deadlift}] (hip-dominant lower). This pairs with Workout A to hit all four push/pull planes plus both squat and hinge patterns weekly.

**Substitutions**: Replace [{Chin Up}] with [{Lat Pulldown}] or band-assisted chin-ups if you can't do bodyweight chin-ups yet. No other swaps recommended — learning these six lifts is the point.

## Set & Rep Scheme

Every exercise: **2x5, 1x5+** (two sets of 5, one AMRAP set).

The first two sets build volume at the prescribed weight. The third set is where you push — do as many reps as possible while keeping form intact. Stop at RPE 8-9 (1-2 reps left in the tank). Don't grind to absolute failure.

The AMRAP set serves double duty: it's your progress indicator (tracking how many reps you get at each weight over time), and it drives the accelerated progression rule.

## Progressive Overload

**Success** (completed all prescribed reps):

| Lift type | Increase per session |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Upper body ([{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Chin Up}]) | +2.5lb |
| Lower body ([{Squat}], [{Deadlift}]) | +5lb |

If you hit **more than 10 reps** on the AMRAP set, double the increase (+5lb upper, +10lb lower).

**Failure** (didn't complete all reps): reduce weight by **10%** next session. Use the lighter weight to chase a new AMRAP rep record — turning deloads into opportunities rather than setbacks.

Each exercise is tracked independently. Stalling on [{Bench Press}] doesn't affect [{Squat}].

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Maximum 3 months.** The program is intentionally low-volume — it's a launchpad, not a destination.

**Move on when**: You're deloading on multiple lifts regularly. Your AMRAP sets barely hit 5. You've been at it for 8-12 weeks and want more volume or variety.

**Good next programs**:
- **GZCLP** — more volume, tiered exercise structure, still linear progression
- **5/3/1 for Beginners** — periodized with built-in assistance templates
- Anything on the [r/Fitness recommended routines page](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/)

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, plates, squat rack, flat bench
- **Microplates** (1.25lb each) for 2.5lb total jumps — buy your own if the gym doesn't stock them, or just use 5lb jumps

If you can't do [{Chin Up}], a pull-up bar with resistance bands or a [{Lat Pulldown}] machine works as a substitute.

## Rest Times

- **Between sets**: 2 minutes. Extend to 3 minutes on heavy sets if needed.
- **Between exercises**: 3-5 minutes.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

For each exercise on Day 1:

1. Start with the empty bar (45lb) for 5 reps
2. Add 10-20lb, do 5 more reps
3. Repeat until form falters or bar speed drops
4. Use that weight as your starting point

**Start lighter than you think.** Linear progression will bring you to challenging weights fast. Starting too heavy leads to early stalls.

[{Chin Up}]: Start at bodyweight (0lb added). Add weight via dip belt once you can complete all sets.

## Common Modifications

- **Add accessories**: After the main lifts, do 2-3 sets each of a push, pull, and core exercise. Good picks: [{Face Pull}], [{Bicep Curl}], [{Hanging Leg Raise}], [{Triceps Pushdown}]. Keep it light, 10-15 reps.
- **Back-off sets**: Drop 20-30% after working sets and do 1-3 extra sets of 5-8 reps for more volume and form practice.
- **Can't do chin-ups**: Use [{Lat Pulldown}] at 3x8-12 until you're strong enough for bodyweight reps.

### Is the Basic Beginner Routine good for complete beginners?

Yes, it's the primary recommended program on the r/Fitness wiki for people who have never lifted before. It focuses on just 3 exercises per session across 6 fundamental barbell movements, so you can learn proper form without being overwhelmed.

### How many days a week is the Basic Beginner Routine?

It's a 3-day program with at least one rest day between sessions. A typical schedule is Monday/Wednesday/Friday. Two alternating workouts (A and B) rotate each week, so Week 1 is A/B/A and Week 2 is B/A/B.

### How long should I run the Basic Beginner Routine?

Run it for a maximum of 3 months. The program is intentionally low-volume to teach you the lifts and build a gym habit. After 8-12 weeks, transition to a program with more volume like GZCLP or 5/3/1 for Beginners.

### What do I do when I stall on the Basic Beginner Routine?

When you fail to complete all prescribed reps on an exercise, reduce the weight by 10% next session. Use the lighter weight to chase a new AMRAP rep record. Each exercise is tracked independently, so stalling on one lift doesn't affect others.

### Can I add accessory exercises to the Basic Beginner Routine?

Yes. After the main 3 lifts, add 2-3 sets each of a push, pull, and core exercise at 10-15 reps. Good picks include face pulls, bicep curls, hanging leg raises, and triceps pushdowns. Keep them light and don't let accessories interfere with your main lifts.

### What if I can't do chin-ups in the Basic Beginner Routine?

Replace chin-ups with lat pulldowns at 3 sets of 8-12 reps, or use band-assisted chin-ups. Work on these until you're strong enough to perform bodyweight chin-ups, then switch to the programmed exercise.
