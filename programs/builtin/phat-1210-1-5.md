A 5-day powerbuilding split that trains each muscle group twice per week — once with heavy compound work (3-5 reps) for strength, and once with higher-rep hypertrophy work (8-20 reps) for muscle growth. Created by Dr. Layne Norton, PHAT uses daily undulating periodization to build size and strength simultaneously, making it a staple for intermediate-to-advanced lifters who refuse to choose between looking big and being strong.

## Origin & Philosophy

PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training) was created by [Dr. Layne Norton](https://biolayne.com/phat/) — a natural bodybuilder, IPF World Champion powerlifter, and PhD in Nutritional Sciences. The program was first published around 2008 on [SimplyShredded](https://simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) and has been a go-to powerbuilding program ever since.

Norton developed PHAT after a friend convinced him to try a hybrid approach — heavy compound work mixed with lighter "pump" training, hitting every body part twice per week. Against conventional bodybuilding wisdom at the time, the combination produced better results than either approach alone. The core principle: strength gains from power days let you use heavier weights on hypertrophy days, creating a greater growth stimulus over time. This is a form of daily undulating periodization (DUP), where you train the same movement patterns at different intensities across the week.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate to advanced (1-2+ years of consistent training). You must be comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Bent Over Row}], and [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] form and know how to manage fatigue across a 5-day training week.
- **Primary goal**: Simultaneous strength and hypertrophy ("powerbuilding").
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. The high volume makes it difficult to sustain on a cut — if cutting, consider dropping 1-2 sets per exercise or switching to a 4-day program like [PHUL](/programs/phul).

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Each muscle group is trained twice per week with different stimuli — heavy loading for strength and high volume for hypertrophy — which research supports as superior to once-per-week training
- Speed work on hypertrophy days reinforces power day movement patterns at 65-70% of your max, building explosiveness and technique
- Comprehensive exercise selection covers all major and minor muscle groups — chest, back, shoulders, arms, quads, hamstrings, and calves all get direct work
- The upper/lower power split followed by body-part hypertrophy days provides variety that keeps training engaging over months

**Cons**

- 5 days per week is a significant time commitment — hypertrophy sessions can run 75+ minutes due to 8-10 exercises per day
- No planned deload protocol or structured failure response in the original program — you need the experience to self-regulate intensity
- The combined power and hypertrophy volume can be difficult to recover from for natural lifters, especially on lower body days where [{Squat}] appears twice per week
- No direct ab work is programmed — you need to add your own on rest days or at the end of sessions

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Hybrid — 2 upper/lower power days + 3 body-part hypertrophy days
- **Periodization style**: Daily undulating periodization (DUP) — same muscle groups trained heavy early in the week and lighter later in the week
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — Day 1 Upper Power, Day 2 Lower Power, Day 3 Rest, Day 4 Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy, Day 5 Lower Body Hypertrophy, Day 6 Chest & Arms Hypertrophy, Day 7 Rest

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Upper Body Power** opens with [{Bent Over Row}] as the heavy horizontal pull (3-5 reps) — this is the primary back strength builder. [{Pull Up}] and [{Inverted Row}] follow as secondary pulling movements in moderate rep ranges to add back volume without excessive CNS fatigue. [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] serves as the heavy press (3-5 reps) — Norton prefers dumbbells for power pressing due to the added stability demand. [{Chest Dip}] adds pressing volume. [{Shoulder Press}] covers vertical pressing. [{Bicep Curl, EZ Bar}] and [{Skullcrusher}] provide direct arm work.

**Lower Body Power** features [{Squat}] as the primary strength movement at 3-5 reps. [{Hack Squat}] and [{Leg Extension}] add quad volume at moderate reps. [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] handles the hip hinge pattern at 5-8 reps — heavy enough for strength but higher reps than squat since it follows heavy squatting. [{Lying Leg Curl}] directly targets hamstrings. [{Standing Calf Raise}] and [{Seated Calf Raise}] cover both gastrocnemius and soleus.

**Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy** starts with speed [{Bent Over Row}] — 6 sets of 3 reps at 65-70% of your power day weight, moving the bar as explosively as possible. This reinforces the motor pattern from power day while building rate of force development. The remainder is classic hypertrophy work: [{Inverted Row}], [{Seated Row}], [{Bent Over One Arm Row}], and [{Lat Pulldown}] cover horizontal and vertical pulling at various rep ranges. [{Shoulder Press}] carries over from the power day, with [{Upright Row}] and [{Lateral Raise}] adding direct delt work missing from the power day.

**Lower Body Hypertrophy** opens with speed [{Squat}] — 6x3 at 65-70% of power day weight. [{Hack Squat}], [{Leg Press}], and [{Leg Extension}] build quad volume across three rep ranges. [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}], [{Lying Leg Curl}], and [{Seated Leg Curl}] cover the posterior chain. [{Standing Calf Raise}] and [{Seated Calf Raise}] provide high-rep calf work.

**Chest & Arms Hypertrophy** starts with speed [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] — same 6x3 explosive protocol. [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}], and [{Incline Chest Fly, Cable}] provide chest volume at different angles and rep ranges. Biceps get [{Preacher Curl}], [{Concentration Curl}], and [{Incline Curl}] across three rep tiers. Triceps get [{Triceps Extension}], [{Triceps Pushdown}], and [{Cable Kickback}] similarly tiered.

**Substitution options**: [{Bent Over Row}] can be swapped for [{Pendlay Row}] or [{T Bar Row}]. [{Pull Up}] can replace [{Lat Pulldown}] and vice versa. [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] can be swapped for barbell [{Bench Press}]. [{Hack Squat}] can be replaced with [{Front Squat}] or [{Leg Press}]. [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] and [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] are interchangeable.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Power day main compounds** ([{Bent Over Row}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Squat}]): 3 sets of 3-5 reps. These are the heaviest working sets of the week — keep 1-2 reps in reserve.
- **Power day secondary compounds** ([{Pull Up}], [{Inverted Row}], [{Chest Dip}], [{Shoulder Press}], [{Hack Squat}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}]): 2-3 sets of 6-10 reps. Heavy enough to build strength, but lighter than the main compounds.
- **Power day isolation** ([{Bicep Curl, EZ Bar}], [{Skullcrusher}], [{Leg Extension}], [{Lying Leg Curl}], [{Standing Calf Raise}], [{Seated Calf Raise}]): 2-3 sets of 6-10 reps.
- **Speed work** ([{Bent Over Row}], [{Squat}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] on hypertrophy days): 6 sets of 3 reps at 65-70% of power day weight. Focus on moving the weight explosively — fast concentric, controlled eccentric. Rest no more than 90 seconds between speed sets.
- **Hypertrophy work** (8-12 rep exercises): 3 sets in the moderate rep range for compound movements. Target controlled tempo with a full stretch at the bottom.
- **Hypertrophy isolation** (12-15 and 15-20 rep exercises): 2-3 sets at higher reps for isolation movements. Shorter rest, focus on the mind-muscle connection and metabolic stress.

## Progressive Overload

This implementation uses **double progression** for all exercises: work within your rep range, and when you can hit the top-end reps on all sets, add weight and reset to the bottom of the range.

For power exercises, [{Squat}] at 3x3 progresses: 3x3 → 3x4 → 3x5, then add 5lb and reset to 3x3. Hypertrophy exercises follow the same logic within their respective rep ranges (e.g., 3x8 → 3x12, then add 5lb and reset to 3x8).

Speed work uses linear progression — add 5lb every session you complete all sets of 3 reps. Since these sets use submaximal weight (65-70% of your max), you should be able to progress regularly. When speed sets start feeling heavy or slow, reset the weight by 10%.

Norton also recommends **rotating power exercises every 2-3 weeks** to prevent plateaus. For example, swap [{Bent Over Row}] for [{Pendlay Row}], or [{Squat}] for [{Front Squat}]. This keeps the movement patterns fresh while still training the same muscle groups.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run PHAT for **12+ weeks**. Norton suggests deloading every 6-12 weeks — use 60-70% of your normal working weights for one week while keeping the same exercises and rep schemes. Take a deload sooner if you notice persistent fatigue, joint aches, or stalling on multiple lifts.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You can't recover between sessions despite deloading, your schedule no longer supports 5 days of training, or you want to specialize in pure strength or pure hypertrophy. Transition to [PHUL](/programs/phul) (4-day version with lower volume), a [5/3/1](/programs/the5314b) variant (for strength focus), or a PPL split (if you want to train 6 days).

## Equipment Needed

The program as written requires a barbell, dumbbells, a cable machine, and machines (hack squat, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, chest press machine, calf raise machines).

**Home gym substitutions**:
- [{Hack Squat}] → [{Front Squat}] or [{Goblet Squat}]
- [{Leg Press}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Lunge}]
- [{Leg Extension}] → [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] or [{Goblet Squat}]
- [{Seated Leg Curl}] / [{Lying Leg Curl}] → [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] or [{Good Morning}]
- [{Chest Press, Leverage Machine}] → [{Bench Press}] or [{Incline Bench Press}]
- [{Lat Pulldown}] → [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}]
- [{Seated Row}] → [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}]
- [{Cable Kickback}] → [{Skullcrusher, Dumbbell}]
- [{Incline Chest Fly, Cable}] → [{Incline Chest Fly}] (dumbbell)
- [{Standing Calf Raise}] / [{Seated Calf Raise}] → [{Calf Press on Leg Press}]

## Rest Times

- **Power day main compounds** ([{Bent Over Row}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Squat}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}]): **3 minutes** between sets. Up to 5 minutes if needed for top sets.
- **Power day accessories**: **90 seconds**
- **Speed work**: **90 seconds** maximum — short rest is part of the stimulus
- **Hypertrophy day compounds** (8-12 rep range): **90 seconds**
- **Hypertrophy day isolation** (12-20 rep range): **60 seconds**

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**Power day main lifts**: Use about 80-85% of your 1RM for 3-5 reps. If you don't know your 1RM, pick a weight where you can do 5 reps with 1-2 reps in reserve.

**Speed work**: Use 65-70% of the weight you use on power day for the same exercise. These should feel light — the focus is bar speed, not grind.

**Hypertrophy exercises**: Pick a weight where you can complete all sets at the bottom of the rep range with 2-3 reps in reserve. It's better to start too light and progress steadily than to start heavy and stall.

**Common mistake**: Starting too heavy on everything. PHAT is a high-volume program — cumulative fatigue across 5 days is real. Start conservative and let the double progression bring you up over 3-4 weeks.

## Common Modifications

- **Add abs**: Tack on 2-3 sets of [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Cable Crunch}] at the end of any training day, or train abs on rest days.
- **Add rear delts**: [{Face Pull}] or [{Reverse Fly}] at the end of upper body or back/shoulder days — the program is light on direct rear delt work.
- **Reduce volume for recovery**: Drop 1-2 sets from each hypertrophy exercise (e.g., 3x8-12 becomes 2x8-12) during the first 2-4 weeks to build up tolerance to the frequency.
- **Swap speed work for straight hypertrophy**: If you don't care about explosiveness, replace the 6x3 speed sets with 3x8-12 at moderate weight. You lose the power development benefit but save time.
- **4-day variant**: Drop one hypertrophy day (usually Chest & Arms) and fold those exercises into the remaining hypertrophy days. This is essentially [PHUL](/programs/phul).
- **Exercise rotation**: Norton recommends swapping power exercises every 2-3 weeks. Good swaps: [{Squat}] → [{Front Squat}], [{Bent Over Row}] → [{Pendlay Row}], [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] → [{Bench Press}].

### Is PHAT good for beginners?

No. PHAT is an intermediate-to-advanced program that requires at least 1-2 years of consistent training experience. The volume, intensity, and 5-day frequency will overwhelm beginners and likely lead to burnout. If you're still making session-to-session progress, a beginner program like GZCLP or Starting Strength will produce faster gains.

### How many days a week is PHAT?

PHAT is a 5-day program, typically run Monday through Saturday with Wednesday and Sunday as rest days. The structure is Upper Power, Lower Power, Rest, Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy, Lower Body Hypertrophy, Chest & Arms Hypertrophy, Rest.

### What is speed work in PHAT and why is it included?

Speed work means performing 6 sets of 3 reps at 65-70% of your power day weight, focusing on moving the bar as explosively as possible. Norton includes it at the start of hypertrophy days to bridge the gap between power and hypertrophy training — it reinforces proper motor patterns, builds rate of force development, and serves as an effective warm-up for the higher-rep work that follows.

### How long should I run PHAT?

Run PHAT for at least 12 weeks to see meaningful progress. Take a deload week (60-70% of working weights) every 6-12 weeks or whenever fatigue is accumulating. Many lifters run PHAT for 6+ months by rotating exercises every 2-3 weeks to prevent staleness.

### Can I do PHAT on a cut?

You can, but recovery will be harder due to the high volume and caloric deficit. Consider dropping 1-2 sets per exercise, reducing speed work from 6 sets to 3-4 sets, or switching to a 4-day program like PHUL. Keep the power day intensity high but reduce total hypertrophy volume.

### What's the difference between PHAT and PHUL?

PHUL is a 4-day upper/lower split with 2 power days and 2 hypertrophy days. PHAT adds a 5th day and splits the hypertrophy work into 3 body-part-specific days (back/shoulders, lower body, chest/arms), providing more total volume and exercise variety. PHAT also includes speed work that PHUL lacks. Choose PHUL if you only have 4 days; choose PHAT if you have 5 and can handle the extra volume.

### How do I know when to deload on PHAT?

Deload when you notice: strength dropping on power days for 2+ consecutive sessions, persistent joint soreness that doesn't resolve with rest days, general fatigue that doesn't improve with extra sleep, or after every 6-12 weeks as a preventive measure. During a deload, use 60-70% of your normal weights while keeping the same exercises and rep scheme.

### Should I go to failure on PHAT?

Norton recommends staying 1-2 reps shy of failure on most sets, especially during the first 2-4 weeks while your body adapts to the volume. After that, you can approach failure on the last 1-2 sets of isolation exercises. Never go to failure on power day main compounds or speed work — the injury risk isn't worth it at those intensities.
