A 6-day bodybuilding split that pairs chest with back, shoulders with arms, and trains legs on a dedicated day — each workout performed twice per week. The defining feature is the agonist-antagonist pairing of chest and back on the same day, which enables efficient supersets and ensures arms are fresh on their dedicated training day. Each muscle group receives two weekly training sessions with moderate-to-high volume.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Arnold Split is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, seven-time Mr. Olympia (1970–1975, 1980), who used this training structure during his competitive bodybuilding career in the 1970s. The program details come from Arnold's book *The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding* (1985, revised 1998), co-authored with Bill Dobbins — widely considered the definitive reference for Golden Era bodybuilding training.

The core principle that separates the Arnold Split from other 6-day programs like Push/Pull/Legs is the **agonist-antagonist pairing** of chest and back on the same day. This has two practical consequences: first, it enables supersets between opposing muscles (bench press into rows, for example), where one muscle rests while the other works. Second, it gives arms a completely fresh training session — triceps aren't pre-fatigued from bench pressing, and biceps aren't pre-fatigued from rows, as they would be in a PPL split. Arnold believed this produced better arm development, and for a man with 22-inch arms, the results spoke for themselves.

This implementation is based on the "Basic Training Program" from the Encyclopedia — the intermediate-level version Arnold recommended for lifters past the beginner stage. Arnold's actual competition routine involved twice-daily sessions with far higher volume, which is neither practical nor advisable for natural lifters.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (6-12+ months of consistent training). You need enough work capacity to handle 6 training days per week and enough gym experience to maintain form under fatigue across 6-7 exercises per session.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy. The volume, exercise selection, and rep ranges are optimized for muscle growth.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. On a cut, recovery from 6 sessions per week will be compromised — consider dropping to a 4-day upper/lower split like [PHUL](/programs/phul) instead.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Each muscle group trained twice per week — [research supports](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/) this as superior to once-per-week training for hypertrophy
- Arms get dedicated fresh training instead of being trained after heavy pressing/pulling, allowing heavier loads and better mind-muscle connection on curls and extensions
- Chest/back pairing creates an intense full-torso pump and enables time-saving supersets between opposing muscle groups
- Deadlift on chest/back day instead of leg day means [{Squat}] performance isn't compromised by prior deadlifting
- Requires only barbells, dumbbells, and a pull-up bar — fully home-gym compatible with no machines needed

**Cons**

- Chest/back on Day 1 means shoulders and triceps (used as synergists during pressing) carry some fatigue into the Shoulders & Arms session on Day 2
- 6 days per week demands excellent recovery — requires adequate sleep (7-9 hours), nutrition (sufficient protein and calories), and stress management
- Lower back is loaded on both chest/back day ([{Deadlift}]) and leg day ([{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], [{Squat}], [{Good Morning}]), which can become a bottleneck for recovery
- No direct rear delt work — [{Chin Up}] and [{Bent Over Row}] provide some stimulus, but dedicated face pulls or reverse flies should be added if rear delts are a weakness
- Not appropriate for beginners who would benefit more from a 3-day full body program like [Arnold's Golden Six](/programs/arnoldgoldensix) or [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp)

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Agonist-antagonist body part split — Chest/Back, Shoulders/Arms, Legs
- **Periodization**: Double progression on all exercises — add reps within a range, then add weight and reset to the bottom of the range
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly — Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri/Sat with Sunday off
- **Typical week**: Chest & Back → Shoulders & Arms → Legs → Chest & Back → Shoulders & Arms → Legs → Rest

The three unique workouts repeat identically in the second half of the week. This is intentional — Arnold's Basic Training Program uses the same exercises both times to build consistent technique and allow session-to-session comparison for progressive overload.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Chest & Back** pairs agonist (chest) and antagonist (back) movements. [{Bench Press}] is the primary chest compound — the strongest horizontal press and best overall chest mass builder. [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] shifts emphasis to the upper (clavicular) chest and adds the deeper range of motion that dumbbells provide. [{Pullover}] is the quintessential Arnold exercise — he believed it expanded the rib cage and served as a bridge between chest and back training, stretching both the pecs and lats under load. [{Chin Up}] provides the primary vertical pull for back width. [{Bent Over Row}] adds horizontal pulling for mid-back thickness. [{Deadlift}] rounds out the session as the heaviest posterior chain movement, building overall back density and grip strength.

**Shoulders & Arms** groups muscles that are NOT pre-fatigued from the previous day's pressing and pulling. [{Overhead Press}] is the primary shoulder compound for anterior and lateral delt mass. [{Lateral Raise}] directly isolates the lateral deltoid head — pressing alone doesn't develop the lateral delts adequately, so high-volume lateral raises are essential. [{Upright Row, Barbell}] targets the upper traps and lateral delts from a different angle than lateral raises. [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] is the primary bicep mass builder with the heaviest loads. [{Incline Curl}] puts the biceps in a stretched position at the bottom of the movement, which research links to greater hypertrophy. [{Bench Press Close Grip}] is the primary tricep compound, allowing heavier loads than isolation movements. [{Skullcrusher}] isolates the triceps with emphasis on the long head.

**Legs** covers quads, hamstrings, and calves. [{Squat}] is the foundation — the single most effective lower body exercise for quad, glute, and core development. [{Lunge}] adds a unilateral component that develops balance, addresses left/right imbalances, and hits the glutes from a different angle. [{Good Morning}] targets the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back through a hip hinge with the bar on the upper back — this was one of Arnold's staple posterior chain exercises from the original program. [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] complements the good morning by targeting the hamstrings and glutes through a different hip hinge angle with the weight in the hands. [{Standing Calf Raise}] isolates the gastrocnemius — calves are stubborn muscles that need consistent high-rep training.

**Substitution options**: [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] can be swapped for [{Incline Bench Press}] (barbell). [{Chin Up}] can be replaced with [{Lat Pulldown}] if you can't do 4 sets of 8 at bodyweight. [{Bent Over Row}] can be swapped for [{T Bar Row}] or [{Pendlay Row}]. [{Upright Row, Barbell}] can be replaced with [{Arnold Press}] if upright rows bother your shoulders. [{Lunge}] can be swapped for [{Bulgarian Split Squat}]. [{Good Morning}] can be replaced with [{Lying Leg Curl}] or [{Seated Leg Curl}] if machines are available.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Heavy compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Squat}]): 3-4 sets in the 8-12 rep range. These are loaded heavy enough to provide mechanical tension while staying in the hypertrophy zone.
- **Secondary compounds** ([{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Chin Up}], [{Bench Press Close Grip}], [{Lunge}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], [{Good Morning}], [{Upright Row, Barbell}]): 3-4 sets in the 10-12 rep range. Moderate loads with controlled tempo.
- **Isolation exercises** ([{Lateral Raise}], [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}], [{Incline Curl}], [{Skullcrusher}], [{Standing Calf Raise}], [{Pullover}]): 3-4 sets in the 10-15 rep range for lateral raises and calves, 10-12 for arms. Strict form with full range of motion.
- **Abs** ([{Crunch}], [{Reverse Crunch}], [{Hanging Leg Raise}]): 3 sets of 10-15 reps at the end of each session — consistent with the original program which included abdominal work every training day.

The original Arnold Split from the Encyclopedia uses a flat 4x10 across most exercises. This implementation uses varied rep ranges with double progression (8-12 for compounds, 10-12 for secondary movements, 10-15 for isolation) to better match modern hypertrophy science while staying close to the original's moderate-rep, moderate-weight approach.

## Progressive Overload

All exercises use **double progression**: work within a rep range, and when you complete all sets at the top of the range, add weight and reset to the bottom.

- **Compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}], [{Squat}], [{Bench Press Close Grip}]): Add **5lb** when all sets hit 12 reps.
- **Deadlift**: Add **10lb** per successful progression.
- **Isolation exercises**: Add **5lb** per successful progression.
- **Standing Calf Raise**: Add **5lb** when all sets hit 20 reps (calves respond to higher rep ranges).

Since each exercise appears twice per week, progression is evaluated after every session. If you hit 4x12 on [{Bench Press}] on Monday, the weight goes up by 5lb and resets to 4x8 for Thursday's session. This means you get twice as many opportunities to progress compared to a once-per-week split.

**When you stall**: If you can't add reps for 2-3 consecutive sessions, reduce the weight by 10-15% and build back up. The wide rep range in double progression means true stalls are rare — most intermediates progress steadily for months.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the Arnold Split for **8-16 weeks** before reassessing. Take a deload week (cut volume in half) every 6-8 weeks if fatigue accumulates — the 6-day frequency makes deloads important.

**Signs it's time to move on**: Consistently failing to recover between sessions (persistent soreness, declining performance), stalling on most exercises despite deloads, or shifting goals toward pure strength.

**Transition to**: [PHUL](/programs/phul) if you want to reduce training days to 4 while keeping 2x weekly frequency and adding a strength component. [Metallicadpa PPL](/programs/metallicadpappl) if you want to keep 6 days but switch to a push/pull/legs structure. [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) if you want to shift toward strength with a proven periodization model.

## Equipment Needed

This program requires only free weights and a pull-up bar — no machines needed:

- **Barbell and plates** — for bench press, overhead press, bent over row, deadlift, squat, stiff leg deadlift, good morning, close-grip bench press, barbell curl, upright row, lunge
- **Dumbbells** — for incline bench press, pullover, incline curl, skullcrusher, lateral raises, standing calf raises
- **Pull-up bar** — for chin-ups and hanging leg raises

**If machines are available**: [{Good Morning}] can be swapped for [{Lying Leg Curl}] or [{Seated Leg Curl}] for more direct hamstring isolation. [{Standing Calf Raise}] can be swapped for [{Standing Calf Raise, Leverage Machine}] for heavier loading.

## Rest Times

- **Heavy compounds** ([{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Squat}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}]): **2 minutes** between sets
- **Secondary compounds** ([{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}], [{Bench Press Close Grip}], [{Lunge}], [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}], [{Good Morning}], [{Upright Row, Barbell}]): **90 seconds**
- **Isolation exercises** ([{Lateral Raise}], [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}], [{Incline Curl}], [{Skullcrusher}], [{Pullover}], [{Standing Calf Raise}]): **60 seconds**
- **Abs**: **60 seconds**
- **During supersets** (if you choose to superset chest/back exercises): minimal rest between the paired exercises (0-30 seconds), then 60-90 seconds before the next pair

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**If you know your 1RM**: Use approximately 65-70% for compound exercises (8-12 rep range) and 50-60% for isolation exercises (10-15 rep range).

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Start with a weight where you can complete all prescribed sets at the bottom of the rep range with 2-3 reps in reserve. The first week should feel moderate, not maximal. Double progression will ramp you up within 2-3 weeks.

**Common mistake**: Starting too heavy on [{Deadlift}] — it comes at the END of chest/back day after 5 other exercises. Use a weight 10-15% lighter than what you'd normally deadlift when fresh. The same applies to [{Good Morning}] and [{Stiff Leg Deadlift}] on leg day after squats and lunges.

## Common Modifications

- **Add rear delts**: Add [{Face Pull}] (3x12) or [{Reverse Fly}] (3x12) at the end of chest/back day. The program is light on direct rear delt work.
- **Superset chest/back exercises**: Pair [{Bench Press}] with [{Chin Up}], [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] with [{Bent Over Row}], and [{Pullover}] as a standalone finisher. This cuts chest/back session time by 15-20 minutes.
- **Add forearm work**: The original program includes [{Wrist Curl}] and [{Reverse Wrist Curl}] (3x10 each) on shoulders/arms day. Add these if forearm size is a priority.
- **Deadlift once per week**: If lower back recovery is an issue, replace [{Deadlift}] on the second chest/back day with [{Lat Pulldown}] or [{Seated Row}].
- **5-day variant**: Drop one of the repeated days (usually the second legs day) for a 5-day schedule: Chest/Back → Shoulders/Arms → Legs → Rest → Chest/Back → Shoulders/Arms → Rest.
- **Swap upright rows**: [{Upright Row, Barbell}] can aggravate shoulders in some lifters. Replace with [{Arnold Press}] or additional [{Lateral Raise}] sets.
- **Add a second calf exercise**: [{Seated Calf Raise}] (3x15) on shoulders/arms day targets the soleus, which [{Standing Calf Raise}] doesn't fully develop.
- **Reduce volume on a cut**: Drop each exercise by 1 set (e.g., 4x8 → 3x8) and maintain the same weight. Prioritize keeping intensity over volume when calories are restricted.

### Is the Arnold Split good for beginners?

No. The Arnold Split is an intermediate-to-advanced program that requires 6 training days per week with 6-8 exercises per session. Beginners (less than 6 months of consistent training) should start with a 3-day full-body program like Arnold's Golden Six or GZCLP, which builds technique faster and provides sufficient volume with less recovery demand.

### How many days a week is the Arnold Split?

The Arnold Split is a 6-day program: Chest & Back, Shoulders & Arms, Legs — each performed twice per week, with one rest day (typically Sunday). The standard layout is Mon-Sat training with Sunday off.

### What's the difference between the Arnold Split and Push/Pull/Legs?

The Arnold Split pairs chest WITH back on the same day and gives shoulders and arms their own dedicated day. PPL groups chest, shoulders, and triceps together (push) and back with biceps (pull). The key advantage of the Arnold Split is that arms are trained fresh without pre-fatigue from heavy pressing or pulling, which many lifters find produces better arm development.

### How long should Arnold Split workouts take?

Most sessions run 60-75 minutes including warmup sets. Chest & Back tends to be the longest due to heavy compound movements like Bench Press and Deadlift. Using supersets between chest and back exercises can cut session time by 15-20 minutes.

### Can I do the Arnold Split as a natural lifter?

Yes, but you need to manage recovery carefully. Arnold trained on anabolic steroids which dramatically improve recovery capacity. As a natural lifter, ensure you're sleeping 7-9 hours, eating sufficient protein (0.7-1g per lb of bodyweight), and taking a deload week every 6-8 weeks. If you can't recover between sessions, switch to a 4-5 day program instead.

### Should I superset exercises on the Arnold Split?

Supersetting chest and back exercises (e.g., Bench Press with Chin Ups) is a popular modification that saves time and was part of Arnold's own training. It's optional — straight sets work fine too. If you superset, rest 0-30 seconds between the paired exercises and 60-90 seconds before the next pair.

### How do I progress on the Arnold Split?

This program uses double progression: work within a rep range (e.g., 8-12 for compounds) and when you complete all sets at the top of the range, add 5 lbs and reset to the bottom. Since each exercise appears twice per week, you get more frequent opportunities to progress than on a once-per-week split.

### Is the Arnold Split better than a bro split?

The Arnold Split trains each muscle group twice per week vs. once in a traditional bro split, which research suggests produces moderately more hypertrophy. It also trains arms fresh instead of after heavy compounds. However, it requires 6 training days vs. 5 for a bro split, which demands better recovery. If you can handle the frequency, the Arnold Split is generally more effective.
