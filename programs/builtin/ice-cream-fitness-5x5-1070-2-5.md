Jason Blaha's Ice Cream Fitness 5x5 is a beginner-focused linear progression program that takes StrongLifts 5x5 and adds accessory exercises for arms, traps, abs, and lower back. Two alternating full-body workouts (A and B) are performed 3 days per week. The main lifts follow a 5x5 set scheme with accessories at 3x8, 2x10, or 3x10. Weight increases every successful session, making it one of the more popular novice programs for lifters who want both strength and size.

## Origin & Philosophy

Ice Cream Fitness (ICF) 5x5 was created by Jason Blaha and popularized through his YouTube channel. The program is an adaptation of the [StrongLifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5/) linear progression model, which itself derives from Bill Starr's original 5x5 methodology.

The core philosophy is that pure 5x5 programs like StrongLifts and Starting Strength neglect direct arm, trap, and ab work — muscles that beginners care about training. ICF solves this by keeping the proven 5x5 compound base and bolting on targeted accessory exercises. The result is a novice bodybuilding program disguised as a strength program: you build a foundation of compound strength while also getting enough isolation volume to grow smaller muscle groups.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: True beginners (0-12 months of lifting) or those returning after a long layoff
- **Goal**: Build strength on the main barbell lifts while also adding muscle size
- **Diet**: Best run on a caloric surplus (bulk). Can be run on a cut with the modified cutting version (3x5 main lifts, 2x8 accessories, weight added every other session instead of every session)
- **Prerequisites**: None — start with the empty bar if needed and add weight each session

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Squatting 3x/week and training every major compound 1.5x/week builds technique quickly
- Direct arm work (curls, close-grip bench, skullcrushers) means you won't neglect arms like on pure 5x5 programs
- [{Shrug, Barbell}], [{Back Extension}], and [{Cable Crunch}] address traps, lower back, and abs that StrongLifts ignores entirely
- Linear progression with 5lb jumps per session means rapid, measurable strength gains for beginners
- Simple A/B alternating structure is easy to follow — no percentage calculations or periodization to manage

**Cons**

- Sessions regularly take 75-90+ minutes due to 8 exercises on Workout A — significantly longer than StrongLifts or Starting Strength
- No direct lateral delt or rear delt work in the base program — consider adding face pulls
- 5x5 [{Squat}] every session is demanding on recovery, especially as weights get heavier — some lifters may need to drop to 3x5 after a few months
- No AMRAP sets means you lose the auto-regulation and progress tracking that programs like the [Basic Beginner Routine](/programs/basicBeginner) provide
- Accessory progression isn't explicitly programmed — Blaha simply says "add weight when you can," which leaves beginners guessing

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, A/B alternating
- **Periodization**: Pure linear progression — add weight every successful session
- **Rotation**: Week 1 = A/B/A, Week 2 = B/A/B, repeat
- **Rest days**: At least 1 day between sessions (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)

Workout A is the heavier session with [{Bench Press}] as the main press and [{Bent Over Row}] at full weight. Workout B swaps in [{Overhead Press}] and [{Deadlift}] (1x5 only), with [{Bent Over Row}] at 90% of Workout A's weight. Both workouts include [{Squat}] 5x5.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

The three main compounds — [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}]/[{Overhead Press}], and [{Bent Over Row}]/[{Deadlift}] — cover all major movement patterns (squat, horizontal push/pull, vertical push, hip hinge). [{Squat}] appears every session because Blaha considers it the single most important exercise for novices.

[{Deadlift}] is limited to 1x5 because Blaha argues it's too taxing on the central nervous system for beginners to handle at 5x5 alongside heavy squats in the same session.

[{Bent Over Row}] appears on both days but at 90% load on Workout B to manage fatigue — you're already deadlifting that day.

The accessories fill gaps: [{Shrug, Barbell}] for upper traps, [{Skullcrusher}] and [{Bench Press Close Grip}] for triceps, [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] for biceps, [{Back Extension}] for the posterior chain, and [{Cable Crunch}] for abs.

**Substitutions**: [{Back Extension}] can be swapped for Good Mornings or Cable Pull Throughs. [{Bench Press Close Grip}] can be swapped for [{Triceps Dip}]. Blaha suggests [{Face Pull}] over Lateral Raises if you want to add shoulder work.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- **Main lifts** ([{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}]): 5x5 — five sets of five reps at the same working weight. This is the classic 5x5 format: heavy enough to build strength, enough volume to drive hypertrophy.
- **[{Deadlift}]**: 1x5 — one working set of five reps. Heavy enough to progress but not so taxing that it wrecks recovery alongside squats.
- **Accessories** ([{Shrug, Barbell}], [{Skullcrusher}], [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}], [{Bench Press Close Grip}]): 3x8 — lighter loads, higher reps for hypertrophy.
- **[{Back Extension}]**: 2x10 — higher reps to build posterior chain endurance.
- **[{Cable Crunch}]**: 3x10 — moderate reps for direct ab work.

All sets are straight sets (same weight across all sets). There are no AMRAP sets in the original program.

## Progressive Overload

**Success**: When you complete all prescribed sets and reps for an exercise, add weight next session:
- [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}]: +5lb per session
- [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], [{Bent Over Row}]: +5lb per session (microplates recommended for upper body lifts — 2.5lb jumps — once 5lb jumps become too aggressive)
- Accessories: add weight when you can complete all sets and reps with good form

**Failure**: If you fail to complete all reps, repeat the same weight next session. If you fail again at that weight, deload by 10% and work back up.

**Cutting modification**: On a caloric deficit, reduce main lifts to 3x5, accessories to 2x8, and only add weight every other successful session.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run ICF for 3-6 months, or until linear progression stalls repeatedly on multiple lifts despite deloads. Signs it's time to move on: you're deloading more than once per month on the same lift, sessions are taking 2+ hours, or you're no longer recovering between sessions.

Transition to an intermediate program like [Madcow 5x5](/programs/madcow), [Texas Method](/programs/texasmethod), or a GZCL variant like [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) which introduces weekly periodization.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates (including microplates/fractional plates for upper body progression)
- Squat rack or power rack
- Flat bench
- Cable machine (for Cable Crunches — substitute with weighted crunches or ab wheel if unavailable)
- Hyperextension bench (for Back Extensions — substitute with Good Mornings using a barbell)

## Rest Times

- **5x5 compound lifts**: 3-5 minutes between sets — these are heavy and you need full recovery
- **3x8 and 2x10 accessories**: 1-2 minutes between sets — lighter loads don't need as much rest

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Start light. Blaha recommends beginning with the empty barbell (45lb) on all main lifts if you're a true beginner, then adding 5lb per session. If you have some training experience, start with a weight you can comfortably handle for 5x5 with perfect form — roughly 50-60% of your estimated 5-rep max.

For accessories, start with a weight that lets you complete all sets and reps without form breakdown. It's better to start too light and progress steadily than to start too heavy and stall early.

If you don't know your 1RM: work up in sets of 5 during your first session, adding weight until the bar speed slows noticeably. Use that as your starting weight.

## Common Modifications

- **Add face pulls**: 3x15-20 at the end of each session for rear delt and rotator cuff health — this is the most common and most recommended addition
- **Add calf raises**: 3x15-20 if calf development matters to you — Blaha says this is acceptable but optional
- **Drop to 3x5 squats**: If recovery is an issue after a few months, reduce squat sets to 3x5 while keeping everything else the same
- **Swap skullcrushers for overhead tricep extensions**: Both are valid tricep isolation movements — use whichever feels better on your elbows
- **Use EZ bar for curls**: If straight bar curls cause wrist pain, switch to an EZ bar curl — this is a common and harmless swap

### Is Ice Cream Fitness good for beginners?

Yes, ICF 5x5 is specifically designed for beginners with 0-12 months of training experience. It combines the proven 5x5 compound strength base with enough accessory work to build visible muscle in the arms, traps, and core — areas that minimalist beginner programs often neglect.

### How long are Ice Cream Fitness workouts?

Expect 75-90 minutes per session, sometimes longer as weights get heavier and you need more rest between 5x5 sets. Workout A has 8 exercises and tends to take slightly longer than Workout B with 7 exercises. This is significantly longer than StrongLifts 5x5 or Starting Strength.

### What's the difference between Ice Cream Fitness and StrongLifts 5x5?

ICF is essentially StrongLifts 5x5 with added accessory exercises. StrongLifts has only 3 exercises per session (Squat, Bench/OHP, Row/Deadlift). ICF adds Barbell Shrugs, Skullcrushers, Barbell Curls, Hyperextensions, Cable Crunches, and Close Grip Bench Press across the two workouts.

### Can I run Ice Cream Fitness on a cut?

Yes, but with modifications. Reduce main lifts from 5x5 to 3x5, reduce accessories from 3x8 to 2x8, and only add weight every other successful session instead of every session. Expect slower strength gains on a caloric deficit.

### Why is Deadlift only 1x5 in Ice Cream Fitness?

Blaha argues that Deadlifts are extremely taxing on the central nervous system, and doing them at 5x5 alongside 5x5 Squats in the same session would impair recovery. One heavy set of 5 is enough stimulus for a beginner to progress on the Deadlift, especially since the Squat and Bent Over Row also train the posterior chain.

### How long should I run Ice Cream Fitness before switching programs?

Run it for 3-6 months, or until you stall repeatedly on multiple lifts despite deloading. If you're deloading more than once a month on the same exercise, it's time to move to an intermediate program with weekly instead of session-to-session progression.

### Can I add exercises to Ice Cream Fitness?

Blaha recommends against modifying the program, but the community consensus is that adding Face Pulls (3x15-20) for rear delt health and optional Calf Raises are acceptable. Avoid adding more compound lifts or significantly more volume — the program already has substantial volume for a beginner.

### What is Ice Cream Fitness 2.0?

In 2019, Blaha released a revised version that reduces working sets from 5x5 to 3x5 and simplifies the accessory selection. The core philosophy remains the same. This Liftosaur implementation uses the original (1.0) version with 5x5 sets, which remains more popular in the training community.
