A 9-week intermediate powerlifting program by Bryce Lewis and The Strength Athlete (TSA). Weeks 1-4 build volume and hypertrophy with moderate loads, week 5 is a deload, and weeks 6-9 peak with heavier singles and doubles. Bench press is trained 3-4 times per week, squat twice, and deadlift twice. Uses a combination of percentage-based and RPE-based loading.

## Origin & Philosophy

The TSA 9-Week Intermediate Approach was created by [Bryce Lewis](https://www.thestrengthathlete.com/) and the coaching team at The Strength Athlete, a powerlifting coaching service that has produced multiple national and world-level competitors. The program was originally released around 2016 and updated to version 2.0 in 2019 based on lessons learned from coaching hundreds of athletes.

The core philosophy is straightforward: start with higher volume at moderate intensity to build muscle and refine technique, shed accumulated fatigue with a mid-cycle deload, then ramp intensity while reducing volume to peak for a competition or mock meet. This block periodization approach addresses specific weaknesses TSA commonly sees in intermediate powerlifters — underdeveloped posterior chains, insufficient technical practice with competition lifts, poor control off the floor in the deadlift, and lagging upper body hypertrophy.

The v2.0 update introduced increased autoregulation through RPE-based top sets paired with percentage-based backoff work, giving lifters the benefits of both approaches.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (1-3 years of consistent barbell training). You should have established 1RMs for [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Deadlift}] tested within the last 3 months.
- **Prerequisites**: Solid technique on the competition lifts. You should be able to gauge RPE with reasonable accuracy (within 0.5-1 RPE).
- **Primary goal**: Peaking maximal strength in the powerlifts for competition or mock meet testing.
- **Best suited for**: Meet prep or offseason blocks (can be chained back-to-back). Works best when eating at maintenance or a small surplus with 7-10 hours of sleep per night.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- [{Bench Press}] trained 3-4 times per week across competition and close-grip/feet-up variations — builds pressing strength and technique rapidly
- Combines percentage-based and RPE-based loading: percentages keep early weeks objective, RPE lets you auto-regulate as intensity climbs in later weeks
- Built-in deload at week 5 manages fatigue systematically rather than leaving it to guesswork
- [{Squat}] gets both a heavy top single/triple day and a volume day each week, developing both maximal strength and work capacity
- Includes paused [{Deadlift}] work to build positional strength off the floor

**Cons**

- Sessions average 60-90 minutes due to the number of working sets across main lifts plus accessories
- Limited direct arm, hamstring, and calf work — you may need to add targeted accessories if those are weak points
- Accessory work is prescribed with RPE ranges rather than exact percentages, which requires experience with subjective intensity rating
- The program is generalized — it does not target individual weak points in the competition lifts (no pin squats, board presses, etc.)
- Deadlift heavy work is intentionally delayed until later weeks, which may frustrate lifters who want to pull heavy early

## Program Structure

- **Split**: 4 days per week. Day 1 is squat-focused, Day 2 is deadlift-focused, Day 3 is a squat volume day with upper body accessories, Day 4 is bench-focused.
- **Periodization**: Block periodization with two phases. Weeks 1-4 (accumulation) emphasize higher volume at moderate intensity. Week 5 is a deload. Weeks 6-8 (intensification) increase load while reducing volume. Week 9 is a final taper into competition/testing.
- **Schedule**: Fixed weekly rotation (e.g., Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri or Mon/Wed/Thu/Sat).
- **Bench press frequency**: 3 sessions per week (Days 1, 2, and 4) with an additional close-grip bench variation — totaling 4 horizontal pressing exposures per week.
- **Squat frequency**: 2 sessions per week (Days 1 and 3). Day 1 includes a heavy top set plus backoff volume, Day 3 is purely percentage-based volume work.
- **Deadlift frequency**: 2 sessions per week — competition deadlift on Day 2 and paused deadlift on Day 4.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

[{Squat}] is trained on Day 1 with a heavy top set (single or triple) followed by higher-rep backoff sets, building both maximal strength and hypertrophy. Day 3 repeats squat as straight sets at moderate intensity, providing additional volume and technique practice without the CNS demand of heavy singles.

[{Bench Press}] appears on Days 1, 2, and 4. Day 1 pairs bench with squat day for moderate backoff work. Day 2 uses heavier singles and moderate sets alongside deadlift. Day 4 is the primary bench day with heavy top sets and backoff work. This high frequency reflects the observation that bench press responds better to frequent exposure than the other lifts.

[{Bench Press Close Grip}] on Day 1 builds triceps lockout strength, the most common bench press sticking point for intermediate lifters.

Feet-Up Bench Press (implemented as [{Legs Up Bench Press}]) on Day 4 removes leg drive to isolate upper body pressing mechanics and build raw pressing strength.

[{Deadlift}] on Day 2 starts with moderate volume in early weeks and shifts to heavier top sets in later weeks. The delayed introduction of heavy pulling allows the body to build strength before testing it.

Paused [{Deadlift}] on Day 4 uses a 1-2 second pause just below the knees to develop positional awareness, bracing endurance, and control off the floor — addressing a common intermediate weakness.

[{Pendlay Row}] develops the upper back strength and lat engagement needed for bench stability and deadlift lockout. [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] provides additional pressing volume at a different angle to support bench strength. [{Seated Row}] targets the upper back and rear delts to counterbalance the high pressing volume. [{Leg Press}] adds quad volume to support squat strength. [{Lat Pulldown}] builds lat width and pulling endurance.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Squat Day 1**: A heavy top set of 1-3 reps at 80-89% (rising over weeks) followed by 3-4 backoff sets of 7-8 reps at 69-75%. This combines maximal strength exposure with hypertrophy work.

**Squat Day 3**: 5-6 straight sets of 3-4 reps at 73-80%. Pure volume work without heavy top sets.

**Bench Day 1** (paired with squat): 3-4 sets of 7-8 reps at 69-75%. Moderate intensity, high reps to build volume.

**Bench Day 2** (paired with deadlift): 5 sets of 4 reps at 72-84%. Moderate-to-heavy straight sets.

**Bench Day 4** (primary bench day): A heavy top set of 1-2 reps at RPE 7-9 (rising over weeks) followed by 2-3 backoff sets of 4-5 reps at 77-86%.

**Deadlift Day 2**: 4-6 sets of 4-5 reps at 74-86%. Volume starts moderate and intensity climbs over weeks.

**Paused Deadlift Day 4**: 4-5 sets of 3-4 reps at 67-78% of deadlift 1RM. Lower intensity with a pause to emphasize positioning.

**Accessories**: All prescribed at RPE 7-8.5 for 3-4 sets of 6-12 reps. The RPE prescription allows auto-regulation based on fatigue from the main lifts.

## Progressive Overload

Weights increase week-over-week within each phase according to a predetermined percentage schedule. In weeks 1-4, percentages rise by approximately 2% per week for both top sets and backoff work. After the week 5 deload, weeks 6-8 continue the upward trend with higher absolute intensity but lower volume.

For RPE-based top sets (bench singles on Day 4, squat/deadlift top sets in later weeks), the target RPE increases by 0.5-1.0 per week, allowing the lifter to auto-select the appropriate load.

There is no built-in failure protocol. If you miss prescribed reps, TSA recommends reducing the weight by 5-10% for the remaining sets and noting the miss. If misses become consistent, retest your 1RM and restart with accurate numbers.

Week 9 serves as a final taper — volume drops dramatically while intensity peaks at RPE 9-9.5 for competition-style singles.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the program for one full 9-week cycle. It is designed as a peaking program, so ideally you schedule a competition or mock meet at the end of week 9.

For offseason use, you can chain cycles back-to-back. After testing new 1RMs in week 9, plug the updated numbers into the next cycle. TSA recommends 2-3 consecutive cycles before switching approaches.

If you outgrow this program (gains stall across multiple cycles), consider moving to the TSA Advanced program or working with a coach for individualized programming.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and power rack (for [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}])
- Flat bench with safety pins or a bench station
- Dumbbells (for [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}])
- Leg press machine (substitute [{Front Squat}] or [{Bulgarian Split Squat}] if unavailable)
- Lat pulldown machine (substitute [{Pull Up}] or [{Chin Up}] if unavailable)
- Cable machine or resistance bands for rows and pull-aparts (substitute [{Bent Over Row, Dumbbell}] if unavailable)

## Rest Times

- **Competition lifts** (squat, bench, deadlift) heavy sets: 3-5 minutes
- **Competition lifts** backoff/volume sets: 2-3 minutes
- **Accessories**: 60-120 seconds

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Enter your current tested 1RMs for [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Deadlift}]. These should be from an actual heavy set at RPE 9-10 within the last 3 months — not theoretical maxes or desired goals.

If you don't know your 1RM, perform a heavy set of 1-3 reps at RPE 9 and use a 1RM calculator. For example, if you bench 225 lbs for 3 reps at RPE 9, your estimated 1RM is approximately 245 lbs.

A common mistake is entering inflated numbers. If your percentages feel too heavy by week 3, reduce your entered 1RM by 5-10%.

## Common Modifications

- **Paused Deadlift substitute**: Deficit deadlifts or Romanian deadlifts if paused deadlifts don't suit your leverages
- **Incline Dumbbell Press substitute**: Barbell incline bench press or dumbbell overhead press
- **Leg Press substitute**: [{Front Squat}], [{Bulgarian Split Squat}], or [{Hack Squat}]
- **Lat Pulldown substitute**: [{Pull Up}] (weighted or bodyweight) or [{Chin Up}]
- **Adding arm work**: Superset 2-3 sets of curls and triceps extensions after the main work on Days 2 and 4
- **Adding hamstring work**: Add [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] or [{Seated Leg Curl}] on Day 3
- **3-day variant**: Combine Days 3 and 4 into a single session, or drop Day 3 and add its squat volume to Day 1

### Is the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program good for beginners?

No. This program assumes you have at least 1-2 years of barbell training experience and can accurately estimate RPE. Beginners should use the TSA Beginner Approach or a linear progression program like Starting Strength or GZCLP first.

### How many days per week is the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program?

The program runs 4 days per week. A typical schedule is Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday — or any 4 days that allow at least one rest day between consecutive training days.

### Can I run the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program on a cut?

It is not ideal. The program is designed for maintenance or a small caloric surplus. The high volume in weeks 1-4 and heavy intensity in weeks 6-9 demand significant recovery resources. If you must cut, expect to miss some reps in later weeks and consider reducing backoff set volume by 1-2 sets.

### What should I do after finishing the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program?

Test your new 1RMs in week 9 (or compete), then either rerun the program with updated maxes or transition to the TSA Advanced program. Many lifters successfully chain 2-3 cycles of this program back-to-back during the offseason.

### How long are the workouts on the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program?

Sessions typically run 60-90 minutes including warm-ups and rest periods. Days 1 and 2 tend to be longer because they pair two competition lifts with accessories. Days 3 and 4 are usually shorter.

### Can I add extra accessories to the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program?

Yes, but keep additions modest — 1-2 exercises per session at most. Popular additions include direct arm work (curls, triceps extensions), hamstring work (leg curls), and additional core work (ab wheel, hanging leg raises). Add them at the end of the session and keep the intensity moderate (RPE 7-8).

### What RPE should I use for the top sets in the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program?

The program specifies exact RPE targets that increase over weeks. Bench singles on Day 4 start at RPE 7 in week 1 and progress to RPE 9 by week 8. Squat and deadlift top sets in weeks 6-8 use RPE 6.5-8.5. If you consistently overshoot RPE targets, lower your entered 1RM by 5%.

### Is the TSA 9-Week Intermediate program good for meet prep?

Yes, it was specifically designed for competition peaking. Week 9 serves as a taper week where volume drops and you perform competition-style singles at RPE 9-9.5. Schedule your meet for the weekend after week 9 completes.
