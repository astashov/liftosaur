Charles Poliquin's German Volume Training (GVT) — also called "The Ten Sets Method" — pairs antagonist muscle groups into supersets and hammers each with 10 sets of 10 reps at 60% of your 1RM. The program runs three workouts per week across a 7-week structure: 4 weeks of high-volume 10x10 work (Phase 1), then 3 weeks at heavier loads with 10x6 (Phase 2). Weight only increases once you complete all 100 reps with the prescribed rest intervals.

## Origin & Philosophy

German Volume Training originated in Germany in the mid-1970s, popularized by Rolf Feser, the national weightlifting coach at the time. Feser used 10x10 protocols in the off-season to help his Olympic lifters move up a weight class. Canadian strength coach Charles Poliquin brought the method to North America in the late 1990s, refined it with antagonist supersets, controlled tempos, and a two-phase periodization structure, and named it German Volume Training.

The core philosophy is simple: subject a motor unit pool to an enormous volume of repeated effort at moderate intensity. By performing 100 reps on a single compound lift, you fatigue muscle fibers so thoroughly that the body is forced to adapt through hypertrophy. Poliquin noted that lifters often experience a brief strength rebound around set 8 due to short-term neural adaptation — a sign the method is working as intended.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (1-3 years of consistent training). You need solid technique on compound lifts since fatigue will degrade form across 10 sets.
- **Prerequisites**: Know your approximate 1RM for the main lifts, or at minimum know a weight you can lift for 20 reps. Comfortable with controlled tempo work.
- **Primary goal**: Hypertrophy and muscular endurance. This is not a strength or powerlifting program — your 1RM may temporarily decrease.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance phases. The extreme volume demands adequate calories for recovery. Not recommended on a cut.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- 100 reps per main compound creates massive time under tension and metabolic stress — two primary drivers of hypertrophy
- Antagonist supersets (e.g., [{Bench Press}] + [{Bent Over Row}]) save time and allow one muscle group to recover while the other works
- Only 3 training days per week with 4 exercises per session — simple to follow and leaves room for recovery
- Two-phase periodization (4 weeks accumulation + 3 weeks intensification) prevents stagnation and develops both size and strength qualities
- Controlled tempo (4-second eccentric on compounds) forces strict form and maximizes muscle fiber recruitment

**Cons**

- Sessions run 60-90 minutes due to 20 total working sets of the 10x10 superset alone (90 seconds rest between each exercise)
- Very limited exercise variety — only 2 compound and 2 accessory exercises per session, which means weaker muscle groups get no direct attention unless you modify
- No direct arm work on Chest & Back day and no direct chest work on Arms & Shoulders day — coverage gaps exist
- The 10x10 sets become extremely monotonous by set 6-7, which can be mentally taxing
- 1RM may decrease temporarily since the program prioritizes volume over intensity

## Program Structure

- **Split**: 3-day antagonist superset split — Day 1: Chest & Back, Day 2: Legs & Abs, Day 3: Arms & Shoulders
- **Periodization**: Two-phase linear periodization — Phase 1 (weeks 1-4) is accumulation (10x10, lighter loads), Phase 2 (weeks 5-7) is intensification (10x6, heavier loads)
- **Schedule**: 3 fixed training days per week with rest days between sessions
- **Superset structure**: Each session has two superset pairs (A1/A2 and B1/B2). You perform A1, rest 90 seconds, A2, rest 90 seconds, repeat for 10 rounds. Then B1/B2 for 3 rounds.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Day 1 (Chest & Back)** pairs [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] (horizontal push) with [{Chin Up}] (vertical pull) for the 10x10 superset. These two movements cover the major anterior and posterior upper body muscles antagonistically — while the chest rests, the back works, and vice versa. Accessories are [{Incline Chest Fly}] and [{Bent Over One Arm Row}] — these target the muscles from different angles at lower volume to fill in gaps the main lifts miss (upper chest and unilateral back work). In Phase 2, the main pair switches to [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] and [{Wide Pull Up}] to shift the stimulus and use heavier loads.

**Day 2 (Legs & Abs)** pairs [{Squat}] (quad-dominant compound) with [{Lying Leg Curl}] (hamstring isolation) for the 10x10 superset. This covers the full leg musculature through opposing movement patterns. Accessories are [{Hanging Leg Raise}] (core) and [{Seated Calf Raise}] (calves) — addressing the two muscle groups the main lifts don't directly hit. In Phase 2, [{Squat}] is replaced by [{Deadlift}] to shift the stimulus toward the posterior chain at heavier loads.

**Day 3 (Arms & Shoulders)** pairs [{Triceps Dip}] (triceps compound) with [{Hammer Curl}] (biceps) for the 10x10 superset. Dips are used instead of a pressing movement because they more directly target the triceps while still loading the shoulders. Hammer curls hit both the biceps and brachioradialis. Accessories are [{Lateral Raise}] (medial delts) and [{Reverse Fly}] (rear delts) — covering the two shoulder heads that receive minimal direct work from the compound movements. In Phase 2, dips are replaced by [{Bench Press Close Grip}] and hammer curls by [{Incline Curl}] to vary the stimulus.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** The main superset pair uses 10 sets of 10 reps at approximately **60% of 1RM**. This is a weight you could normally lift for about 20 reps in a single set. The first few sets feel easy — by sets 7-10, completing 10 reps becomes a serious challenge. Accessories use 3 sets of 10-12 reps at a lighter intensity. No sets are taken to failure — the cumulative fatigue across 10 sets is the stimulus.

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-7):** The main superset pair drops to 10 sets of 6 reps at approximately **70% of 1RM**. The reduced reps allow heavier loading while maintaining the 10-set structure. Accessories use 3 sets of 6-8 reps. This phase consolidates the size gained in Phase 1 by exposing the newly enlarged muscle fibers to higher mechanical tension.

## Progressive Overload

Weight increases only when you complete all prescribed reps across all 10 sets with the prescribed rest intervals. When that happens, increase weight by 4-5% (approximately 5lb for upper body lifts, 10lb for lower body lifts) the following week.

If you cannot complete all 10 reps on every set, keep the same weight next session. It's normal to get 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 8, 9 on the first attempt at a given weight. Do not reduce the weight mid-session to chase rep numbers — maintaining consistent load across all 10 sets is the point.

Between Phase 1 and Phase 2, the exercises change and the loading scheme shifts. You will need to set new working weights for Phase 2 based on your 1RM.

Accessories use double progression — increase reps within the prescribed range first, then bump weight and reset to the bottom of the range.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the full 7-week program (both phases), then take a deload week before starting a new training block. Poliquin recommends running GVT no more than once or twice per year — it's a shock protocol, not a year-round approach.

Signs it's time to move on: you can complete all 10x10 sets easily at the prescribed rest intervals, or you've finished both phases and gained noticeable size.

After GVT, transition to a program with lower volume and higher intensity to convert your new muscle mass into strength:
- [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) for a balanced strength-hypertrophy approach
- [Madcow 5x5](/programs/madcow) for intermediate strength progression
- [Texas Method](/programs/texasmethod) for a simple strength-focused follow-up

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates
- Squat rack or power rack
- Flat bench and incline bench
- Dumbbells (for curls, lateral raises, flies, rows)
- Pull-up / chin-up bar
- Dip station (or parallel bars)
- Lying leg curl machine (or resistance band alternative)
- Seated calf raise machine (or substitute with standing calf raises)

**Home gym substitutions:**

- [{Lying Leg Curl}] → [{Romanian Deadlift}] or Nordic hamstring curls
- [{Seated Calf Raise}] → [{Standing Calf Raise}] with barbell or dumbbells
- [{Incline Chest Fly}] → [{Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell}] with lighter weight
- [{Lateral Raise}] → resistance bands
- [{Triceps Dip}] → [{Bench Press Close Grip}] if no dip station available

## Rest Times

- **10x10 main supersets (Phase 1)**: 90 seconds between each exercise in the superset. Perform A1, rest 90s, A2, rest 90s, repeat.
- **10x6 main supersets (Phase 2)**: 90 seconds between each exercise in the superset.
- **Accessories (B1/B2)**: 60 seconds between each exercise in the superset.

Strict rest timing is critical to the program's effectiveness. Use a stopwatch — as fatigue builds, the temptation to extend rest periods grows. The program only works if rest intervals stay constant.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Set your 1RM in the app for the main compound lifts. The program calculates 10x10 working weights at **60% of 1RM** for Phase 1 and **70% of 1RM** for Phase 2.

If you don't know your 1RM, find a weight you could lift for about 20 reps in one max-effort set — that's approximately your 60% 1RM starting point.

**Common mistake**: starting too heavy. If you can't complete at least 7-8 reps on your last set during your first session, the weight is too high. Drop by 5-10% and try again. The first 3-4 sets should feel almost easy — that's by design.

## Common Modifications

- Swap [{Bench Press, Dumbbell}] for [{Bench Press}] (barbell) if you prefer — barbells allow more total load but dumbbells provide better range of motion and unilateral balance
- Replace [{Chin Up}] with [{Lat Pulldown}] if you cannot perform 10 sets of 10 bodyweight chin-ups
- Replace [{Hammer Curl}] with [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] for more direct biceps emphasis
- Add [{Face Pull}]s at the end of Day 1 for shoulder health if you have a history of shoulder issues
- If sessions run too long, reduce accessory work from 3 sets to 2 sets — the 10x10 main work is the priority
- For a 4-day variant, split Chest & Back into separate days and pair each with a smaller muscle group

### Is German Volume Training good for beginners?

No. GVT requires solid technique on compound lifts because form degrades significantly across 10 sets under fatigue. Beginners should spend at least 6-12 months building a strength base with a program like Starting Strength or GZCLP before attempting GVT. The program also requires knowledge of your 1RM or working weights, which beginners typically haven't established.

### How long should I run German Volume Training?

The full program is 7 weeks — 4 weeks of Phase 1 (10x10) and 3 weeks of Phase 2 (10x6). Poliquin recommends running it no more than once or twice per year. Running it longer than the prescribed duration risks overtraining and diminishing returns since the body adapts to the volume stimulus.

### Can I do German Volume Training on a cut?

It's not recommended. The extreme training volume (100 reps per main exercise) creates significant recovery demands that require adequate caloric intake. On a caloric deficit, you'll struggle to recover between sessions, likely lose strength, and may not see the hypertrophy benefits the program is designed for.

### What weight should I start with for the 10x10 sets?

Use approximately 60% of your 1RM, which corresponds to a weight you could lift for about 20 reps in a single set. The first 3-4 sets should feel relatively easy. If you can't complete at least 70 reps across all 10 sets on your first attempt, the weight is too heavy.

### Will German Volume Training increase my 1RM?

Likely not in the short term. GVT is a hypertrophy program, not a strength program. Your 1RM may temporarily decrease during the program because you're training exclusively in the 10-rep and 6-rep range with moderate weights. However, the added muscle mass provides a larger base to build strength from in subsequent training blocks.

### Why does GVT use antagonist supersets?

Pairing opposing muscle groups (like Bench Press with Chin Ups) allows one muscle group to recover while the other works, reducing total session time without sacrificing rest between sets for the same muscle. Research also suggests that performing an antagonist exercise between sets may slightly enhance performance on the subsequent set through reciprocal inhibition.

### What's the difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2?

Phase 1 (weeks 1-4) uses 10 sets of 10 reps at 60% 1RM — this is the high-volume accumulation phase that drives hypertrophy through metabolic stress and time under tension. Phase 2 (weeks 5-7) uses 10 sets of 6 reps at 70% 1RM — this intensification phase exposes the newly grown muscle fibers to heavier loads, consolidating the size gains and building some strength. The exercises also change between phases to provide a new stimulus.

### How much rest should I take between sets in GVT?

90 seconds between each exercise in the main 10x10 superset, and 60 seconds between accessory exercises. Strict timing is essential — the program's effectiveness depends on consistent rest intervals. As fatigue builds across the 10 sets, the temptation to rest longer increases, but extending rest undermines the metabolic stress that drives hypertrophy.
