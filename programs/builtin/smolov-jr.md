A condensed 3-week variant of the full Smolov cycle focused on one lift (squat or bench press). Four training days per week with the same set/rep scheme repeated each week but at progressively heavier loads. Extreme volume and frequency make this a short-term peaking protocol, not a sustainable long-term program.

## Origin & Philosophy

Smolov Jr. is an abbreviated version of the full 13-week Smolov Squat Routine, originally created by Russian Master of Sports Sergey Smolov. While the full Smolov cycle includes multiple mesocycles with deload weeks, Smolov Jr. extracts just the base mesocycle and compresses it into a standalone 3-week protocol.

The program appeared in Western lifting communities in the mid-2000s, primarily through forum discussions and strength training websites. It gained popularity as a bench press peaking program despite being derived from a squat routine — the rep and intensity scheme translates well to upper body pressing.

The core philosophy is simple: high frequency (4x/week), high volume (6-10 sets per session), and sustained intensity (70-85% of 1RM) create a potent overreaching stimulus. The program assumes you'll recover enough between sessions to progress weekly, then take a deload week afterward to supercompensate.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Advanced lifters with at least 2-3 years of consistent training
- **Prerequisites**: Solid technique on the target lift, established work capacity for high volume, ability to squat or bench 3+ days per week without breaking down
- **Goal**: Short-term strength peak for a competition, testing week, or breaking through a plateau
- **Not recommended for**: Beginners, anyone with joint issues, or lifters without a solid training base. The volume is punishing and recovery demands are extreme.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Rapid strength gains: increases of 15-30lb on squat or 10-20lb on bench in just 3 weeks are common
- High frequency builds motor pattern efficiency and improves technique under fatigue
- Simple structure: same 4 workouts every week, just heavier each time
- Sessions take 45-60 minutes for the main lift plus minimal accessories
- Can be run back-to-back (with a deload week between) for continued gains

**Cons**

- Brutal recovery demands: 4 heavy sessions per week leaves little room for other training
- High injury risk if technique breaks down under fatigue
- No programmed accessories: you train one lift and that's it
- Not sustainable beyond 3 weeks without a deload
- Requires accurate 1RM — starting too heavy leads to missed reps by Week 2
- Day 4 (10 sets of 3 reps) can take 90 minutes with proper rest between sets

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Single-lift focus, 4 days per week
- **Periodization**: Linear — same set/rep scheme each week with 5-10lb jumps week-to-week
- **Schedule**: Typically Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday with at least one rest day after Saturday before starting the next week
- **Volume**: 19-20 working sets per week (6+7+8+10 sets across 4 days)

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Smolov Jr. is designed for **one lift only**: either [{Squat}] or [{Bench Press}]. The original program was for squats, but it's commonly adapted for bench press.

You can run Smolov Jr. on two lifts simultaneously (e.g., squat and bench) if you have exceptional recovery capacity, but this is not recommended for most lifters. Running it on deadlift is also discouraged — the high volume and frequency don't suit the deadlift's recovery demands.

**No substitutions**: This program is specifically built around the competition squat or bench press. Variations like front squats, incline bench, or close-grip bench defeat the purpose.

## Set & Rep Scheme

Each week follows the same pattern across 4 training days:

- **Day 1 (Monday)**: 6 sets of 6 reps at 70% of 1RM
- **Day 2 (Wednesday)**: 7 sets of 5 reps at 75% of 1RM
- **Day 3 (Friday)**: 8 sets of 4 reps at 80% of 1RM
- **Day 4 (Saturday)**: 10 sets of 3 reps at 85% of 1RM

No sets are taken to failure. All reps should be completed with 1-2 reps in reserve (roughly RPE 8-9). The volume accumulates across the week, with Day 4 being the most grueling session.

## Progressive Overload

**Week-to-week progression**:
- Add 5-10lb to all lifts for upper body (bench press)
- Add 10-20lb to all lifts for lower body (squat)

The exact increment depends on how the previous week felt:
- If Week 1 felt easy to moderate → add 10lb (bench) or 20lb (squat)
- If Week 1 felt difficult → add 5lb (bench) or 10lb (squat)
- If you failed sets or were extremely sore → keep the same weight

**On failure**: If you miss reps during a session, finish as many sets as possible, then keep the weight the same for the next session of that week. Missing reps in Week 2 or 3 suggests you started too heavy or aren't recovering adequately.

**No built-in deload**: The program is 3 weeks of sustained overreaching. After completing Week 3, take 4-7 days of light training or complete rest, then test your new 1RM.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Run for exactly 3 weeks.** This is a peaking block, not a program you repeat indefinitely.

After finishing:
1. **Deload for 4-7 days**: Light technique work (50-60% of 1RM) or complete rest
2. **Test your new 1RM**: Most lifters see 10-30lb squat gains or 10-20lb bench gains
3. **Transition to a sustainable program**: Return to your regular training or run another peaking block if needed

**Running consecutive cycles**: You can run Smolov Jr. twice in a row with a full deload week between cycles. Some lifters report 30-60lb squat gains across two back-to-back cycles. Beyond two cycles, diminishing returns and injury risk increase sharply.

**What next**: After testing your new max, transition to a program with more balanced volume and recovery. Good options include intermediate programs like [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp), [Madcow 5x5](/programs/madcow), or a 5/3/1 variant.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, weight plates, squat rack (for squat variant)
- Barbell, weight plates, flat bench, spotter or safety bars (for bench variant)

**Substitutions**: None. If you don't have access to a barbell and rack, this program isn't for you.

## Rest Times

Rest times are critical — this is a strength program, not conditioning work.

- **Day 1 (6x6)**: 2-3 minutes between sets
- **Day 2 (7x5)**: 3 minutes between sets
- **Day 3 (8x4)**: 3-4 minutes between sets
- **Day 4 (10x3)**: 3-5 minutes between sets, up to 8 minutes for the final sets if needed

Day 4 sessions can easily take 75-90 minutes when factoring in warm-ups and adequate rest. Rushing rest periods defeats the purpose — you need full ATP recovery to complete all sets.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Smolov Jr. is percentage-based. You need an accurate 1RM before starting.

**Finding your 1RM**:
1. If you've tested your 1RM in the past 2-4 weeks, use that number
2. If not, work up to a heavy single (RPE 9-10) and use that as your 1RM
3. Alternatively, use a 3-5RM and estimate your 1RM via a calculator (the app provides one)

**Critical**: Use a **training max** (90-95% of your true 1RM) rather than a competition max, especially if this is your first Smolov Jr. cycle. The program is unforgiving if you start too heavy — you'll miss reps in Week 2 and grind to a halt.

**Example**: If your true 1RM bench is 300lb, use 285lb (95%) as your program 1RM. Week 1 Day 1 would be 6x6 at 200lb (70% of 285lb).

## Common Modifications

**Accessories**: The program recommends skipping accessories entirely. If you must add work, keep it minimal:
- **For bench Smolov Jr**: Add 3 sets of horizontal rows (e.g., [{Bent Over Row}]) on 2 days to maintain shoulder health
- **For squat Smolov Jr**: Add light hamstring work (e.g., [{Leg Curl}]) if needed, but avoid heavy deadlifts

**Simultaneous squat + bench**: Advanced lifters sometimes run Smolov Jr for both squat and bench simultaneously. This requires exceptional recovery and is not recommended unless you've run the program successfully on one lift first.

**Equipment variations**: If you lack a spotter for bench press, use safety bars in a power rack or consider running the squat variant instead.

**Other lifts**: Do not run this program for deadlift or overhead press — the volume and frequency are not appropriate for those movement patterns.

### Is Smolov Jr good for beginners?

No. Smolov Jr is designed for advanced lifters with at least 2-3 years of consistent training. Beginners lack the work capacity, technique proficiency, and recovery ability to handle 4 heavy sessions per week. Stick to beginner linear progression programs until you've built a solid strength base.

### How many days a week is Smolov Jr?

Smolov Jr is a 4-day-per-week program, typically run Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday. You need at least one full rest day after Saturday before starting the next week. The program lasts 3 weeks.

### Can I run Smolov Jr for bench press and squat at the same time?

Technically yes, but it's not recommended unless you have exceptional recovery capacity and have successfully completed Smolov Jr on a single lift first. Running both simultaneously means 8 heavy sessions per week with minimal room for accessories or other training.

### What do I do after finishing Smolov Jr?

Take a deload week: 4-7 days of light training (50-60% of 1RM) or complete rest. Then test your new 1RM. Most lifters see 10-30lb gains on squat or 10-20lb on bench. After testing, return to a sustainable training program — Smolov Jr is a peaking block, not a long-term plan.

### How much weight should I add each week on Smolov Jr?

For bench press, add 5-10lb per week. For squat, add 10-20lb per week. If Week 1 felt easy, use the higher end. If it felt difficult, use the lower end. If you failed sets or were extremely sore, keep the weight the same.

### Can I run Smolov Jr more than once?

Yes. You can run consecutive Smolov Jr cycles with a full deload week between them. Some lifters report 30-60lb squat gains across two back-to-back cycles. Beyond two cycles, diminishing returns and injury risk increase significantly.

### What if I miss reps during Smolov Jr?

Finish as many sets as possible that session, then keep the weight the same for the next workout. Missing reps suggests you started too heavy or aren't recovering adequately. If you're missing reps consistently in Week 2 or 3, consider ending the cycle early and taking a deload.

### Should I use my true 1RM or a training max for Smolov Jr?

Use a training max (90-95% of your true 1RM), especially on your first cycle. The program is brutal when calculated from a true max — you'll miss reps in Week 2. It's better to finish strong on a conservative 1RM than grind to a halt halfway through.
