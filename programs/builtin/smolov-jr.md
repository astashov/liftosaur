Smolov Jr is a 3-week high-frequency, high-volume peaking cycle derived from the base mesocycle of the full [Smolov Squat](/programs/smolov-squat) program. You train one lift 4 days per week at 70-85% of 1RM with fixed set/rep schemes (6x6, 7x5, 8x4, 10x3) and add 10 lbs each week. This implementation uses [{Bench Press}] — the most popular Smolov Jr application — but the exercise can be swapped to [{Squat}] or [{Overhead Press}].

## Origin & Philosophy

Smolov Jr is an abbreviated version of the base mesocycle from the **full 13-week Smolov Squat Program**, attributed to Russian Master of Sport **Sergey Smolov** and introduced to Western lifters by **Pavel Tsatsouline** in a 2001 Powerlifting USA article. The full Smolov base phase uses 4x9, 5x7, 7x5, and 10x3 at increasing percentages — Smolov Jr adjusts this to 6x6, 7x5, 8x4, and 10x3. The modification distributes reps across more sets with fewer reps each (e.g., 6x6 instead of 4x9 = same 36 total reps, but each set is further from failure), making the program demanding but survivable as a standalone 3-week block.

The core philosophy is **forced adaptation through frequency and volume**: benching 4 days per week at 70-85% of 1RM produces a massive overreaching stimulus. After a deload week, the body supercompensates and you test a new 1RM.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Intermediate (1-3+ years of consistent barbell training). You should be past beginner linear progression and have solid bench press technique.
- **Prerequisites**: Minimum 1x bodyweight [{Bench Press}] with consistent form. You need the work capacity to handle 130+ working reps per week of the same lift.
- **Primary goal**: Short-term maximal strength on a single lift. This is a peaking program, not a general strength builder.
- **Best suited for**: Maintenance or surplus calories. Running Smolov Jr on a cut significantly increases injury risk and limits recovery.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Benching 4 times per week at high volume rapidly improves technique — groove the movement pattern until it's automatic
- 3-week commitment is manageable compared to the full 13-week [Smolov Squat](/programs/smolov-squat) cycle
- Reported bench increases of 15-25 lbs (7-12 kg) in 3 weeks — one of the fastest short-term bench peaking protocols available
- Can be repeated back-to-back with a rest week between cycles for continued gains
- Simple structure with no exercise selection decisions — show up and do the prescribed sets

**Cons**

- All other lifts ([{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}]) receive zero direct work and may temporarily decline
- Shoulder and pec injuries (impingement, strains) are the most commonly reported issues — lifters with existing shoulder problems should not attempt this program
- No back, leg, or accessory work — running this repeatedly without addressing muscle imbalances creates injury risk
- Recovery demands are high — under-eating or under-sleeping is the most common reason for program failure
- Some coaches argue the gains are partially temporary and reverse after returning to normal training volume

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Single-exercise specialization — every session is [{Bench Press}] only
- **Periodization**: 3-week linear overload block followed by a deload and 1RM test (overreaching/supercompensation model)
- **Schedule**: 4 sessions per week. A typical layout is Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday, but any arrangement with at least one rest day between most sessions works. If you train consecutive days, place Day 4 (10x3, heaviest) before Day 1 (6x6, lightest) so the easier session follows the hardest.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

This is a single-exercise program: [{Bench Press}]. Every session is barbell bench press. The rationale is pure specialization — by directing 100% of training volume and recovery toward one lift, you maximize the overreaching stimulus and subsequent supercompensation.

No accessory work is programmed. Light face pulls, band pull-aparts, and rowing (2-3 sets) are acceptable for shoulder health and can be added without impacting recovery. Heavy compounds ([{Squat}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}]) should be avoided or kept very light during the cycle.

To run Smolov Jr for [{Squat}] instead, swap all [{Bench Press}] exercises to [{Squat}] and consider using larger weekly increments (10-15 lbs). The full [Smolov Squat](/programs/smolov-squat) program is also available as a dedicated 13-week cycle.

## Set & Rep Scheme

Four distinct daily rep schemes, each at a fixed percentage of 1RM:

- **Day 1: 6x6 @ 70%** — highest total volume (36 reps), moderate load. The "easiest" day, though 6 sets of 6 at 70% is still demanding due to accumulated fatigue.
- **Day 2: 7x5 @ 75%** — 35 total reps, slightly heavier. The middle ground between volume and intensity.
- **Day 3: 8x4 @ 80%** — 32 total reps, heavy. Each set requires concentration and solid form.
- **Day 4: 10x3 @ 85%** — 30 total reps at near-maximal weight. The hardest day — heavy triples demand full recovery between sets.

Total weekly volume: ~133 working reps. The descending rep counts with ascending intensity across the week create a wave-like loading pattern that balances volume and intensity stimuli.

## Progressive Overload

**Weekly weight additions**: After each week, +10 lbs is added to all working weights on top of the percentage-based starting weights. The increment is configurable in exercise settings — use +5 lbs for a more conservative approach if recovery is a concern.

- **Week 1**: Base percentages (70/75/80/85%)
- **Week 2**: Base percentages + 10 lbs
- **Week 3**: Base percentages + 20 lbs

**After the cycle**: Rest 4-7 days (deload), then test a new 1RM. The program updates your 1RM based on the test result.

**Failure protocol**: If you cannot complete all prescribed reps in a session, your starting 1RM was too high. Drop the increment from 10 lbs to 5 lbs. If you continue to fail, reduce your 1RM by 5-10% and restart the cycle.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the program for exactly **3 weeks + 1 deload/test week** (4 weeks total). Unlike the full Smolov, Smolov Jr can be repeated — running 2 consecutive cycles with a rest week between is a common approach for bigger gains (30+ lbs on bench reported).

**Good follow-up programs**:
- [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) — return to balanced training with submaximal bench work to maintain gains
- [nSuns LP](/programs/nsuns) — high-volume linear progression across all main lifts
- [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) — structured linear progression to rebuild neglected lifts

**Signs it worked**: New bench PR at the end of the cycle. Your bench technique feels tighter and more efficient.

**Signs to bail early**: Persistent sharp shoulder or pec pain (not just fatigue), inability to complete sessions even with reduced increments, or sleep/nutrition issues you can't resolve.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates (including fractional plates if using 5 lb increments)
- Bench press station with safety pins or a spotter

Wrist wraps are optional but helpful at the heavier percentages (80-85%). No machines, dumbbells, or cables are needed.

## Rest Times

- **Day 1 (6x6 @ 70%)**: 3 minutes between sets
- **Day 2 (7x5 @ 75%)**: 3 minutes between sets
- **Day 3 (8x4 @ 80%)**: 3-4 minutes between sets
- **Day 4 (10x3 @ 85%)**: 4-5 minutes between sets. The last few sets may need up to 6-8 minutes.
- **1RM Test**: 5+ minutes before max attempts

The priority is completing all prescribed reps. Take whatever rest you need — rushing through sets at the expense of completed reps defeats the purpose.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Set your [{Bench Press}] 1RM in the app before starting. The program calculates all working weights as percentages of this 1RM.

**Conservative approach (recommended)**: Use **90% of your true 1RM** as the starting value. This gives you room for the +10 lb/week additions. If your true max is 275 lbs, enter 247 lbs.

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Use the app's built-in RM calculator — test a heavy set of 3-5 reps and let it estimate your max. Then use 90% of that estimate.

**Common mistake**: Starting with your true 1RM. By Week 3, you're lifting 70%+20 lbs, 75%+20 lbs, 80%+20 lbs, and 85%+20 lbs. Starting too heavy turns the last week into a grind that you can't recover from.

## Common Modifications

- **Squat version**: Swap [{Bench Press}] for [{Squat}]. Use +10-15 lb weekly increments. Consider knee sleeves and more warmup sets.
- **Conservative progression**: Use +5 lb weekly increments instead of +10 lb. Recommended for lifters under 180 lbs bodyweight, women, or anyone concerned about recovery.
- **Shoulder prehab**: Add 2-3 sets of face pulls or band pull-aparts after each session. Light rowing (3x10-15) is also acceptable.
- **Two consecutive cycles**: Run weeks 1-3, deload for a week, update your 1RM, and run weeks 1-3 again. This extends the program to ~8 weeks total and is a common approach for maximizing gains.
- **3-day version**: Spread the same 4 workouts across 3 training days per week. This extends the cycle to ~4 weeks of training but improves recovery for lifters who struggle with 4 sessions per week.

### Is Smolov Jr good for beginners?

No. Smolov Jr is designed for intermediate lifters with at least 1-2 years of consistent barbell training. Beginners making linear progression gains should run programs like GZCLP, Starting Strength, or Phrak's Greyskull LP instead. The volume and frequency of Smolov Jr will cause more harm than good without an established base of strength and technique.

### How much will Smolov Jr add to my bench press?

Most lifters report gains of 15-25 lbs (7-12 kg) on bench press over a single 3-week cycle. Some report up to 30 lbs. Results depend on training history, nutrition, sleep, and how close you are to your genetic ceiling. Running two consecutive cycles with a rest week between typically yields 25-40 lbs total.

### Can I run Smolov Jr for squat instead of bench press?

Yes. Smolov Jr works well for squats — swap Bench Press for Squat in the program and use +10-15 lb weekly increments. For a full squat specialization cycle, consider the 13-week Smolov Squat program instead, which includes an intro phase, base mesocycle, switching phase, and heavy peaking phase.

### Can I do other exercises during Smolov Jr?

Minimize accessory work. Light face pulls, band pull-aparts, and rowing (2-3 sets) are fine for shoulder health. Avoid heavy squats, deadlifts, and overhead pressing — your recovery capacity should go entirely to bench press. Upper back and rear delt work is the one exception because it supports shoulder health without taxing bench recovery.

### What if I fail a set during Smolov Jr?

First, check your starting 1RM — it was probably too high. Drop the weekly increment from 10 lbs to 5 lbs. If you continue to fail, reduce your 1RM by 5-10% and restart the cycle. Do not grind through failed reps with degraded form — the injury risk at these volumes is real.

### How should I schedule my Smolov Jr training days?

The most popular schedule is Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday. Any 4-day arrangement works as long as most sessions have at least one rest day between them. If you must train consecutive days, pair Day 4 (10x3, heaviest) with Day 1 (6x6, lightest) so the easier session follows the hardest.

### Can I repeat Smolov Jr back to back?

Yes, unlike the full Smolov program, Smolov Jr can be repeated. Take a full deload week (4-7 days of rest or very light work) between cycles, test your new 1RM, and start fresh with updated percentages. Two consecutive cycles is common; three or more in a row increases overtraining risk significantly.

### What's the difference between Smolov and Smolov Jr?

Smolov is a 13-week squat specialization program with 5 distinct phases (intro, base, switching, intense, taper). Smolov Jr is a 3-week program based on only the base mesocycle, with adjusted set/rep schemes (6x6 instead of 4x9 on Day 1, 8x4 instead of 7x5 on Day 3). Smolov Jr is shorter, less intense overall, applicable to multiple lifts, and can be repeated.
