## Origin & Philosophy

Simple Jack'd was created and shared by /u/SumoDadlifts on [r/weightroom](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/) in February 2021 after running it for over 2 months and adding 89 pounds to his total. The program combines the Bulgarian Method's high-frequency approach (training the same lift daily) with Smolov's structured volume accumulation into a flexible one-week template that can be run indefinitely.

The core philosophy: frequent exposure to heavy weights (85% daily) builds skill and strength rapidly, while supplemental work at lower intensities accumulates volume without excessive fatigue. Unlike rigid programs, Simple Jack'd gives you control over training frequency (4-6 days per week), exercise selection, and progression speed.

Version 2.0 is recommended over 1.0 - it uses variable rep counts based on intensity (40 reps at 70%, 30 at 75%, 20 at 80%, 10 at 85%) instead of a flat 40 reps regardless of load.

## Who It's For

**Experience level:** Intermediate to advanced (1+ years of consistent training). You should be comfortable with high training frequency and managing fatigue.

**Prerequisites:** Solid technique on compound lifts. The high frequency demands good form - poor technique will break down under daily heavy loading.

**Primary goal:** Rapid strength gains on specific lifts. Works for powerlifting meet prep or breaking through plateaus on main movements.

**Cut/bulk/maintenance:** Best on maintenance or surplus calories. The high frequency and volume require adequate recovery. Cutting may compromise performance and increase injury risk.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Daily heavy lifting (85%) builds technical proficiency fast on your chosen focus lift
- Flexible training frequency (4-6 days) lets you adjust based on recovery
- Simple structure - one focus lift daily, supplemental work with clear rep targets
- Creator reported +89 lbs on his total in 2 months
- No complicated periodization or percentages to track weekly

**Cons:**
- Requires 4-6 training sessions per week minimum - high time commitment
- No structured deload or fatigue management - you must self-regulate
- Only one focus lift at a time limits what you can peak simultaneously
- High frequency can be tough on joints and connective tissue
- Minimal guidance on exercise selection for supplemental work

## Program Structure

The program repeats a single-week template indefinitely. Each training session includes:
1. **Focus lift** - one main movement trained daily at 85% for 3-6 reps (as many sets as needed)
2. **Supplemental lift** - one of three variation categories (hinge, press, squat) rotated across sessions

Training 4-6 days per week gives flexibility to adjust frequency based on recovery. You rotate which supplemental category you train each session, cycling through all three categories over multiple workouts before repeating.

The program does not prescribe specific days of the week - you simply repeat the weekly structure and adjust rest days as needed.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Focus lift:** Choose the movement you want to improve most - typically a competition lift ([{Squat}](/programs/squat), [{Bench Press}](/programs/bench-press), [{Deadlift}](/programs/deadlift)) or a main press ([{Overhead Press}](/programs/overhead-press)). You'll train this same lift every session at 85%.

**Supplemental lifts:** Organized into three categories:
- **Hinge:** [{Romanian Deadlift}](/programs/romanian-deadlift), [{Good Morning}](/programs/good-morning), variations that target the posterior chain
- **Press:** [{Incline Bench Press}](/programs/incline-bench-press), [{Overhead Press}](/programs/overhead-press), pressing variations
- **Squat:** [{Front Squat}](/programs/front-squat), [{Box Squat}](/programs/box-squat), squatting variations

Pick supplemental lifts that support your focus lift. If benching is your focus, choose pressing variations. If squatting or deadlifting is your focus, include both hinge and squat categories.

You can swap supplemental lifts freely within their category. After minimum 8 sessions (2 cycles) on a supplemental lift, you may switch to another variation in that category.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Focus lift:**
- 3-6 total reps at 85% of training max
- Perform in as many or few sets as you wish
- Daily minimum - must hit this every training session

**Supplemental lifts (Version 2.0):**
- 40 reps at 70%
- 30 reps at 75%
- 20 reps at 80%
- 10 reps at 85%

The intensity rotates each time you train that supplemental category. Perform the total reps in as few sets as possible while maintaining good form. For example, 40 reps at 70% might be 4x10 or 5x8 depending on how you feel that day.

The decreasing rep counts as intensity increases prevent excessive fatigue accumulation.

## Progressive Overload

**Focus lift:**
- After 4-8 successful training days (your choice within that range), increase training max by 2.5%
- "Successful" means completing the 3-6 reps at 85% with good form

**Supplemental lifts:**
- After 4 training days (1 cycle through the intensity progression), increase training max by 2.5%
- Each supplemental lift progresses independently based on how frequently you train it
- Must complete minimum 8 sessions before switching to a new supplemental lift

**Stalling:** The program provides no explicit stall protocol. If you fail to hit the prescribed reps, keep the weight the same or reduce by 5-10% and rebuild. The high frequency means small setbacks are normal - don't panic over single bad sessions.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run Simple Jack'd for 2-4 months or until fatigue becomes unmanageable. The creator ran it for 2+ months with excellent results, but most lifters will need to deload or switch programs by the 3-4 month mark due to accumulated fatigue.

**Signs it's time to move on:**
- Consistently failing to hit the daily 85% focus lift
- Joint pain or persistent soreness that doesn't resolve with rest days
- Motivation tanking from the repetitive daily structure
- Sleep or appetite disruption from high training stress

**What next:** Transition to a periodized program with structured deloads, like [{GZCL: Jacked & Tan 2.0}](/programs/gzcl-jacked-and-tan-2), [{nSuns LP}](/programs/nsuns-lp), or [{5/3/1: Building the Monolith}](/programs/531-building-the-monolith). These provide more recovery while maintaining the strength you built.

## Equipment Needed

As written: barbell, power rack, bench, and plates. The program assumes barbell training for focus and supplemental lifts.

**Substitutions:**
- If no barbell: substitute dumbbell variations for presses ([{Bench Press, Dumbbell}](/exercises/bench-press-dumbbell))
- Limited equipment: bodyweight variations for supplemental work ([{Push Up}](/exercises/push-up), [{Pistol Squat}](/exercises/pistol-squat))
- Machines: can use [{Leg Press}](/exercises/leg-press) or [{Seated Row, Leverage Machine}](/exercises/seated-row-leverage-machine) for supplemental lifts, though free weights are preferred for carryover to the focus lift

## Rest Times

The original program does not specify rest times. General recommendations:

**Focus lift (85%):** 3-5 minutes between sets. You're working at high intensity daily, so prioritize full recovery between efforts.

**Supplemental lifts:** 2-3 minutes for heavier sets (80-85%), 90 seconds to 2 minutes for lighter sets (70-75%). Since you're chasing rep targets, rest enough to maintain quality but don't drag out sessions excessively.

Sessions will likely take 60-90 minutes depending on rest times and how many sets you need to hit your rep targets.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

**Focus lift:**
1. Find your true 3-rep max (3RM) - a weight where the 3rd rep is a hard grind but doable with good form
2. Use 85% of that 3RM as your starting training max
3. If you know your 1RM instead: start with 75% of 1RM (roughly equivalent to 85% of 3RM)

**Common mistake:** Starting too heavy. The daily frequency accumulates fatigue fast. If you can't consistently hit 3-6 reps at your chosen weight, drop by 5-10% and rebuild.

**Supplemental lifts:**
1. Estimate your 1RM on each supplemental variation
2. Use percentages of that 1RM (70%, 75%, 80%, 85%)
3. Start conservatively - if 40 reps at 70% feels easy, you can bump up next cycle

**Finding your 1RM:** Use the app's built-in 1RM calculator. Enter a recent rep max (e.g., "I did 225 lbs for 8 reps") and it will estimate your 1RM. Don't test true 1RMs before starting - the program has enough volume without pre-fatiguing yourself.

## Common Modifications

**Lower training frequency:** If 6 days per week is too much, train 4 days per week. This slows progression but reduces fatigue. The creator recommended "no fewer than 4 days per week."

**Multiple focus lifts:** Version 2.0 allows two focus lifts per session instead of one. Only attempt this if you're highly conditioned - it significantly increases session length and fatigue.

**Add accessories:** After supplemental work, add 2-3 light accessory exercises (8-12 reps, 2-3 sets) for weak points or injury prevention. Keep these minimal - the focus and supplemental work is plenty of volume.

**Exercise rotation:** If a supplemental lift causes discomfort, swap immediately to another variation in the same category. No need to wait for the minimum 8 sessions.

**Autoregulation:** On bad days, reduce the focus lift to 3 reps instead of 6, or lower the intensity to 80% instead of 85%. The high frequency means one lighter session won't kill progress.

### Is Simple Jack'd good for beginners?

No. Simple Jack'd requires at least 1 year of consistent training experience. Beginners lack the technical proficiency to handle daily heavy lifting (85%) safely, and their recovery capacity isn't sufficient for 4-6 sessions per week. Beginners should start with programs like [Starting Strength](/programs/starting-strength) or [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) that build foundational strength with lower frequency.

### How many days per week should I train Simple Jack'd?

The program allows 4-6 training days per week. The creator recommended "no fewer than 4 days per week." Start with 4-5 days and add a 6th session only if recovery is solid (good sleep, no persistent soreness, hitting all prescribed reps consistently). More is not always better - inadequate recovery will tank progress.

### Can I run Simple Jack'd while cutting?

Possible but not recommended. The high training frequency (4-6 days per week) and daily heavy work (85%) require substantial recovery resources. On a calorie deficit, you'll likely struggle to maintain performance and increase injury risk. Run it on maintenance calories or a slight surplus for best results.

### What do I do if I fail to hit 3-6 reps on the focus lift?

Keep the weight the same or reduce by 5%. Simple Jack'd has no explicit stall protocol - you self-regulate. If you fail once, it might just be a bad day (sleep, stress, nutrition). If you fail 2-3 sessions in a row, drop the weight by 5-10% and rebuild. The high frequency means small setbacks won't destroy progress.

### Can I train Simple Jack'd with multiple focus lifts?

Version 2.0 technically allows two focus lifts per session. However, this dramatically increases session length (potentially 90+ minutes) and fatigue. Only advanced lifters with excellent recovery should attempt this. Most people should stick to one focus lift and use supplemental work to address other movements.

### How do I pick which supplemental lifts to use?

Choose variations that directly support your focus lift. If [{Bench Press}](/exercises/bench-press) is your focus, prioritize pressing supplementals like [{Incline Bench Press}](/exercises/incline-bench-press) or [{Overhead Press}](/exercises/overhead-press). If [{Squat}](/exercises/squat) or [{Deadlift}](/exercises/deadlift) is your focus, include both hinge variations ([{Romanian Deadlift}](/exercises/romanian-deadlift)) and squat variations ([{Front Squat}](/exercises/front-squat)) in your rotation.

### Do I need a deload week with Simple Jack'd?

The program doesn't prescribe structured deloads. However, if you're running it for 8+ weeks, consider taking a deload every 4-6 weeks: drop intensity to 75-80% for the focus lift and cut supplemental volume by 30-40%. Or simply take 3-4 consecutive rest days when fatigue builds up. High-frequency programs accumulate fatigue faster than traditional programming.

### How long does each Simple Jack'd workout take?

Expect 60-90 minutes per session. The focus lift takes 15-30 minutes depending on rest times and how many sets you need for 3-6 reps. Supplemental work takes another 30-45 minutes to complete the rep targets (40 reps at 70%, 30 at 75%, etc.). Sessions can stretch to 90+ minutes if you're doing two focus lifts or adding accessories.
