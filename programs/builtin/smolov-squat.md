The Smolov Squat Program is a 13-week Russian squat specialization cycle that combines extreme training volume with heavy peaking to drive rapid squat gains. Attributed to Russian Master of Sport Sergey Smolov and popularized by Pavel Tsatsouline, the program is built around four distinct phases: an introductory microcycle, a punishing 4-day-per-week base mesocycle, an active recovery switching phase, and a heavy intense mesocycle that peaks to a new 1RM.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Smolov Squat Program is attributed to **Sergey Smolov**, a Russian Master of Sport and weightlifting coach from the 1970s. It was introduced to Western lifters largely through **Pavel Tsatsouline**. The intense mesocycle portion (weeks 9-12) was originally designed by **I.M. Feduleyev**, a powerlifting and weightlifting coach from Moscow.

The core philosophy is simple: force adaptation through extreme squat-specific volume and frequency. During the base mesocycle, you squat 4 days per week with 130+ working reps at 70-85% of 1RM. The body has no choice but to adapt. The program then shifts to a heavy peaking phase with sets at 90-95% to convert that accumulated volume into maximal strength. Claims of 40-100 lb squat increases over the 13 weeks are common in program reviews.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Advanced (2-3+ years of consistent barbell training). This is not a program for anyone still making linear progression gains.
- **Prerequisites**: At minimum a 1.5x bodyweight [{Squat}] with solid technique. Many coaches recommend a 2x bodyweight squat or 350+ lb squat before attempting Smolov.
- **Primary goal**: Maximal squat strength. All other lifts will likely stagnate or temporarily decline.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or aggressive surplus. Multiple sources recommend a significant caloric surplus (+500-1000 calories/day) and 8+ hours of sleep. Running this on a cut is not viable.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Squatting 3-4 times per week at high volume forces rapid technique improvement and neural adaptation
- The structured 5-phase approach (intro → base → switching → intense → taper) manages fatigue accumulation better than simply squatting heavy every day
- Reported squat increases of 40-100 lbs in 13 weeks — one of the most effective short-term squat peaking protocols available
- Fixed 13-week timeline gives a clear start and end date, making it easier to commit fully
- The base mesocycle's simple +20lb/+10lb weekly weight additions are easy to track and provide tangible weekly progress

**Cons**

- All other lifts ([{Bench Press}], [{Deadlift}], [{Overhead Press}]) will receive zero direct work and may temporarily decline — you are trading well-rounded strength for squat specialization
- Knee injuries (patellar tendinitis, bursitis, general inflammation) are the most commonly reported issue — lifters with existing knee problems should not attempt this program
- Recovery demands are extreme — requires significant caloric surplus, quality sleep, and minimal other physical activity
- High dropout rate — many lifters cannot complete the full 13 weeks due to accumulated fatigue, joint pain, or life circumstances
- Some coaches argue the gains are partially temporary and reverse quickly after returning to normal training volume

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Squat specialization — every session is squats only
- **Periodization**: Block periodization across 5 phases — accumulation (intro + base), recovery (switching), intensification (intense), and peaking (taper)
- **Phase 1 — Intro Microcycle (Weeks 1-2)**: Ramps volume and intensity across 3 sessions per week to prepare the body for the base mesocycle. Week 1 uses mixed sets (8s, 5s, doubles, singles), Week 2 tests heavy singles of 5.
- **Phase 2 — Base Mesocycle (Weeks 3-5)**: The defining phase. 4 squat sessions per week with fixed set/rep schemes (4x9, 5x7, 7x5, 10x3) at increasing weights. Week 4 adds +20 lbs to all working weights; Week 5 adds another +10 lbs.
- **Phase 3 — 1RM Test (Week 6)**: Rest and test your new squat 1RM. Update it in the app before continuing.
- **Phase 4 — Switching Phase (Weeks 7-8)**: Active recovery with speed/explosive squat work at 50-60% of your new 1RM. Keeps the movement pattern fresh without accumulating fatigue.
- **Phase 5 — Intense Mesocycle (Weeks 9-12)**: Heavy peaking phase with 3 sessions per week. Working sets climb from 80-85% up to 90-95% as volume gradually decreases.
- **Phase 6 — Taper & Final Test (Week 13)**: One heavy session followed by rest and a final 1RM attempt.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

This is a single-exercise program: [{Squat}]. Every session, every phase, every set is the barbell back squat. The rationale is pure specialization — by eliminating all other training stimuli, 100% of your recovery capacity is directed toward squat adaptation. The base mesocycle's 130+ weekly reps at moderate-to-heavy loads drives muscular hypertrophy in the quads, glutes, and spinal erectors, while the intense mesocycle's heavy singles, doubles, and triples build maximal strength and neural drive.

No accessory work is programmed or recommended during the base and intense mesocycles. Upper body maintenance work is acceptable during the switching phase (weeks 7-8), but lower body accessories like [{Leg Press}], lunges, or [{Deadlift}] should be avoided throughout.

During the switching phase, [{Box Squat}] or paused squats can substitute for regular squats to develop explosiveness out of the hole.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Intro Microcycle (Weeks 1-2)**: Mixed sets descending from 8 reps to singles across a range of 65-90% of 1RM. Week 2 uses single sets of 5 at 80-85% to assess readiness.

**Base Mesocycle (Weeks 3-5)**: Four distinct daily rep schemes, all at a fixed percentage:
- Day 1: 4x9 @ 70% — high reps, moderate load for volume accumulation
- Day 2: 5x7 @ 75% — moderate reps, slightly heavier
- Day 3: 7x5 @ 80% — heavier load, more sets, fewer reps
- Day 4: 10x3 @ 85% — near-maximal triples for strength and neural adaptation

Each day produces 30-36 working reps. Total weekly volume: ~136 reps. Weight increases +20 lbs in Week 4 and another +10 lbs in Week 5 (total +30 lbs above the initial percentage-based weight).

**Intense Mesocycle (Weeks 9-12)**: Built-in ramping from 60-65% up to working sets at 85-95%. Volume gradually decreases across the 4 weeks while intensity increases — a classic peaking taper. Week 9 tops out at 90%, while Weeks 11-12 include multiple sets at 95%.

## Progressive Overload

The program uses three distinct progression mechanisms across its phases:

**Base Mesocycle (Weeks 3-5)**: Fixed weight additions on top of percentage-based starting weights. Week 3 establishes the baseline at 70/75/80/85% of 1RM. Week 4 adds +20 lbs to ALL working weights across all 4 days. Week 5 adds another +10 lbs (total +30 lbs above Week 3).

**1RM Retest (Week 6)**: After the base mesocycle, you rest and test a new squat 1RM. This resets the percentage basis for the remaining phases.

**Intense Mesocycle (Weeks 9-12)**: Percentages of the new 1RM increase week-to-week (85% → 90% → 95%) while total volume decreases. This is a classic peaking structure — shedding fatigue while pushing intensity toward a new max.

**Failure protocol**: There is no built-in deload or failure reset. If you cannot complete a session, rest an extra day and attempt it again. If you repeatedly fail sessions in the base mesocycle, your starting 1RM was too high — restart the phase with 90% of your original 1RM.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the program for exactly **13 weeks** — it is not designed to be repeated back-to-back. After the final 1RM test, transition to a balanced program that maintains your squat gains while rebuilding other lifts.

**Good follow-up programs**:
- [Texas Method](/programs/texasmethod) — weekly squat progression with full-body work to rebuild bench, deadlift, and press
- [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b) — monthly progression across all main lifts with manageable volume
- [Madcow 5x5](/programs/madcow) — weekly progression with full-body training

**Signs the program worked**: You hit a significant squat PR at Week 6 and another at Week 13. Your squat technique feels automatic. Your quads and glutes have visibly grown.

**Signs to bail early**: Persistent sharp knee pain (not just soreness), inability to complete base mesocycle sessions after multiple attempts, or illness/injury that prevents adequate recovery.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates
- Squat rack or power rack with safety pins/bars

**Strongly recommended**: Lifting belt, squat shoes (heeled), knee sleeves. The volume and intensity make joint support essential.

No machines, dumbbells, or cables are needed — this is a barbell-only program.

## Rest Times

- **Intro Microcycle**: 3 minutes between sets
- **Base Mesocycle Day 1-2** (4x9, 5x7): 3 minutes between sets
- **Base Mesocycle Day 3** (7x5): 4 minutes between sets
- **Base Mesocycle Day 4** (10x3): 5 minutes between sets
- **Switching Phase**: 60-90 seconds (speed work — short rest is intentional)
- **Intense Mesocycle**: 4-5 minutes between working sets. Lighter ramping sets can use 2-3 minutes.
- **Taper/Test**: 5+ minutes before max attempts

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Set your [{Squat}] 1RM in the app before starting. The program calculates all working weights as percentages of this 1RM.

**Conservative approach (recommended)**: Use **90% of your true 1RM** as the starting value. Multiple experienced coaches and program reviews recommend this to prevent burnout in the base mesocycle. If your true max is 400 lbs, enter 360 lbs as your 1RM.

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Use the app's built-in RM calculator — test a heavy set of 3-5 reps and let it estimate your max. Then use 90% of that estimate.

**Common mistake**: Starting with your true 1RM. The base mesocycle adds 30 lbs on top of percentage-based weights by Week 5. If you start too heavy, you won't survive the 4x9 at 70%+30 lbs.

## Common Modifications

- **[Smolov Jr](/programs/smolov-jr)**: A popular 3-week abbreviated version that runs only the base mesocycle with slightly different set schemes (6x6, 7x5, 8x4, 10x3). Often used for [{Bench Press}] as well as [{Squat}]. Good option if you can't commit to 13 weeks.
- **Knee protection**: Add 5-10 minutes of foam rolling quads and IT bands before each session. Knee sleeves are strongly recommended. Some lifters use light [{Leg Extension}] (1-2 sets of 20) as a warmup to flush blood into the knees.
- **Switching phase alternatives**: Replace speed squats with [{Box Squat}], paused squats, or squat jumps. Some lifters add light upper body work during this phase since it's the only recovery window.
- **Metric increments**: The original Russian program likely used +10 kg (Week 4) and +5 kg (Week 5) instead of +20/+10 lbs. If training in kg, use these values.

### Is the Smolov squat program good for beginners?

No. Smolov is an advanced squat specialization program designed for lifters with at least 2-3 years of consistent barbell training. You should have a minimum 1.5x bodyweight squat with solid technique. Beginners still making linear progression gains should run programs like Starting Strength, GZCLP, or Phrak's Greyskull LP instead.

### How much will the Smolov program add to my squat?

Most lifters report gains of 40-100 lbs (20-45 kg) over the full 13 weeks. The base mesocycle alone typically adds 30-60 lbs. Results depend heavily on training history, nutrition, sleep, and starting strength level. Lifters closer to their genetic ceiling will see smaller gains.

### Can I do other exercises besides squats during Smolov?

During the base and intense mesocycles, no lower body accessories should be performed — no deadlifts, leg press, or lunges. Your recovery capacity must go entirely to squats. Light upper body maintenance work (bench, press, rows) is acceptable during the switching phase (weeks 7-8) only. Many lifters find their deadlift still improves slightly due to squat carryover.

### What is the Smolov Switching Phase?

The switching phase (weeks 7-8) is an active recovery period between the base and intense mesocycles. You squat 2-3 times per week at 50-60% of your new 1RM with an emphasis on speed and explosiveness. The goal is recovery from the base mesocycle's extreme volume while keeping the squat pattern fresh. Box squats, paused squats, and squat jumps are common substitutions.

### Can I run Smolov for bench press?

The full 13-week Smolov is designed specifically for squats. However, Smolov Jr. (a 3-week version of just the base mesocycle) is commonly and successfully used for bench press. The set schemes (6x6, 7x5, 8x4, 10x3) at 70-85% transfer well to the bench press movement.

### What if I can't complete the base mesocycle workouts?

If you fail a session, rest an extra day and try again. If you repeatedly fail, your starting 1RM was too high. Drop it to 90% of your original value and restart the base mesocycle from Week 3. Do not push through with degraded form — the injury risk at these volumes is real.

### How should I eat during the Smolov program?

Eat in a significant caloric surplus — at minimum +500 calories per day, with some sources recommending +1000. Prioritize protein (1g per pound of bodyweight minimum) and sleep 8+ hours per night. This program is not compatible with cutting or even maintenance-level calories. The recovery demands are extreme and under-eating is the most common reason for program failure.
