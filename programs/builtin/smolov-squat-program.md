A 13-week squat specialization program from Soviet-era coaching, made famous in the West by Pavel Tsatsouline's 2001 article in Powerlifting USA. You'll squat 3-4 times per week across five phases — Phase In, Base Mesocycle, Switching, Intense Mesocycle, and Taper — culminating in a new 1RM test. Expect to add 40-100 lbs to your squat if you survive the brutality.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Smolov Squat Program was created by Sergey Smolov, a Russian Master of Sport, and used to train Soviet weightlifters from the 1970s onward. It reached Western audiences when [Pavel Tsatsouline wrote about it](https://www.smolovjr.com/smolov-squat-routine/) in Powerlifting USA magazine in 2001.

The core philosophy is simple: squat frequently, squat heavy, squat a lot. The program pushes the squat to its limits through high frequency (3-4x/week), high volume (up to 10x3 in a single session), and progressive overload that adds flat weight on top of already-heavy percentage-based loads. Everything else — deadlifts, Olympic lifts, most accessory work — is either eliminated or reduced to bare-minimum maintenance.

## Who It's For

- **Experience level**: Advanced (3+ years of consistent barbell training). Your squat technique must be rock-solid because you'll be performing hundreds of heavy reps over 13 weeks.
- **Prerequisites**: Minimum 1.5x bodyweight squat. Previous experience with high-frequency squatting. No current knee, hip, or back injuries.
- **Primary goal**: Peaking squat strength. This is a specialization program — everything else takes a back seat.
- **Best suited for**: Bulking or maintenance with high caloric surplus. The recovery demands are extreme — you need 8+ hours of sleep and significant caloric intake daily. Not suitable for cutting under any circumstances.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Delivers dramatic squat strength gains — 40-100 lbs added to 1RM is commonly reported by experienced lifters
- Forces rapid neurological adaptation through high-frequency squatting (3-4x/week)
- Clearly structured with specific percentages and progressions — no guessing what to do each day
- The Phase In (weeks 1-2) eases you into the volume before the program ramps up
- Finite 13-week commitment with a clear peak and 1RM test at the end

**Cons**

- Extremely high injury risk, especially for the knees — many lifters report joint inflammation, bursitis, or overuse injuries
- Requires near-total sacrifice of other training — deadlifts, Olympic lifts, and most upper body work must be eliminated or drastically reduced
- The Base Mesocycle (weeks 3-5) demands squatting 4x/week with sessions like 10x3 @ 85% + 30lb — mentally and physically crushing
- Recovery demands are extreme — requires a caloric surplus, 8+ hours of sleep, and minimal life stress to complete
- The Intense Mesocycle (weeks 9-12) involves multiple sets at 90-95% of 1RM, which many lifters simply cannot sustain

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Squat-only specialization — every training day is squats
- **Periodization**: Block periodization with five distinct phases, each serving a different purpose
- **Phase In (weeks 1-2)**: 3 days/week. Introduces the body to frequent heavy squatting with moderate volume
- **Base Mesocycle (weeks 3-5)**: 4 days/week. High volume (4x9, 5x7, 7x5, 10x3) with +20lb added in week 4 and +30lb in week 5 on top of percentage-based weights
- **Max Test (week 6)**: 2 days of rest followed by 1RM testing. Update your 1RM in the app after this test — the Intense Mesocycle percentages are based on this new number
- **Switching Phase (weeks 7-8)**: 3 days/week. Speed/dynamic effort work at 50-60% of new 1RM to shed fatigue and build power
- **Intense Mesocycle (weeks 9-12)**: 3 days/week. Heavy lifting at 80-95% of your new 1RM with low reps
- **Taper + Max Test (week 13)**: Reduced volume leading to a final 1RM test

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

This is a single-exercise program — every session is [{Squat}]. The logic is straightforward: to maximize squat strength in 13 weeks, you do nothing but squat. Any other lower body work would compete for recovery resources that the squat needs.

Upper body maintenance work (bench press, overhead press, rows) can be added at low volume (2-3 sets, 2x/week) on non-squat days or after lighter squat sessions, but this is not programmed here. Add it yourself if needed, but keep it minimal.

## Set & Rep Scheme

The program uses five distinct set/rep phases:

**Phase In (weeks 1-2)**: Mixed rep ranges from 1-8 reps at 65-90% of 1RM. Week 1 uses pyramid-style sessions (sets of 8, 5, 2, and 1), while week 2 uses simple singles of 5 at 80-85%.

**Base Mesocycle (weeks 3-5)**: Four fixed set/rep patterns repeated each week with increasing weight:
- Day 1: 4x9 @ 70% (+ weekly offset)
- Day 2: 5x7 @ 75% (+ weekly offset)
- Day 3: 7x5 @ 80% (+ weekly offset)
- Day 4: 10x3 @ 85% (+ weekly offset)

Week 3 uses straight percentages. Week 4 adds 20lb to all sets. Week 5 adds 30lb to all sets.

**Switching Phase (weeks 7-8)**: Light speed work — 6x3 at 50-60% of your new 1RM, focusing on explosive bar speed.

**Intense Mesocycle (weeks 9-12)**: Heavy singles, doubles, triples, and quads at 60-95% of your new 1RM. Most working sets fall in the 85-95% range. Each session builds from lighter warm-up sets to heavy working sets.

**Taper (week 13)**: Reduced volume with a final 1RM test on the last day.

## Progressive Overload

**Phase In**: No progression — fixed percentages of starting 1RM.

**Base Mesocycle**: The set/rep patterns stay identical, but flat weight is added each week — +20lb in week 4, +30lb in week 5 (both measured from the week 3 baseline). This means by week 5, you're squatting 10x3 at 85% + 30lb.

**After week 6**: You test a new 1RM. **You must update your 1RM in the app** (tap the exercise name, then edit 1RM) before continuing to weeks 7-13. All Intense Mesocycle and Taper percentages are based on this new 1RM.

**Intense Mesocycle**: No week-to-week weight progression — the percentages simply get heavier as weeks progress (more sets at 90-95%). The loading wave builds intensity across the 4-week block.

**Failure protocol**: If you cannot complete prescribed reps, reduce all weights by 5-7% without cutting sets or reps. If you consistently fail, the program may be too aggressive — consider running [Smolov Jr.](/programs/smolov-jr) instead.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run it once as a 13-week block. Do not repeat it back-to-back — your joints and CNS need recovery. After completing Smolov, take 1-2 weeks of deload with minimal squatting, then transition to a balanced program that includes all main lifts. Good follow-up programs include [Madcow 5x5](/programs/madcow) or [5/3/1: Boring But Big](/programs/the531bbb) to maintain your new squat strength while rebuilding deadlift and upper body pressing.

Most lifters should not run the full Smolov more than once per year. If you want to revisit it sooner, consider running just the Base Mesocycle (4 weeks) as a standalone block.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and squat rack (or power rack). That's it. No other equipment is needed since the program is squat-only. If you want to add upper body maintenance work, you'll need a bench.

## Rest Times

- **Phase In**: 3-5 minutes between working sets
- **Base Mesocycle**: 3-5 minutes between sets. Up to 8 minutes is acceptable on the 10x3 day — completing all reps at the prescribed weight is more important than rushing
- **Switching Phase**: 60-90 seconds between sets (speed work — keep it fast)
- **Intense Mesocycle**: 3-5 minutes between working sets. Up to 8 minutes for sets above 90%
- **Taper**: 3-5 minutes between sets

## How to Pick Starting Weights

All weights are calculated as percentages of your 1RM. Before starting, you need an accurate squat 1RM.

**If you know your 1RM**: Use 90-95% of your true 1RM as the number you enter. This is critical — using your actual max will make the program nearly impossible to complete, especially the Base Mesocycle. For example, if your true 1RM is 400lb, enter 360-380lb.

**If you don't know your 1RM**: Test it before starting, or use an estimated 1RM from a recent heavy set (e.g., if you did 315lb for 5 reps, your estimated 1RM is ~355lb — enter 320-340lb).

**Common mistake**: Starting with your actual 1RM. The percentages are already aggressive. The +20lb and +30lb weight jumps in the Base Mesocycle will push you beyond your limits if you start too heavy.

## Common Modifications

- **Base Mesocycle only**: Many lifters run just weeks 3-6 (the Base Mesocycle + max test) as a standalone 4-week peaking block. This avoids the extreme demands of the Intense Mesocycle while still delivering significant squat gains (20-40 lbs).
- **Smolov Jr. instead**: If the full 13-week program is too much, [Smolov Jr.](/programs/smolov-jr) uses the Base Mesocycle's 4-day structure (6x6, 7x5, 8x4, 10x3) over 3 weeks and can be applied to squat or bench press.
- **Reducing the weight jumps**: If +20lb/+30lb is too aggressive for the Base Mesocycle, use +10lb/+20lb instead. Lighter lifters and women should scale these jumps proportionally.
- **Adding upper body work**: You can add 2-3 sets of bench press, overhead press, and rows on 2 non-squat days per week (or after lighter squat sessions). Keep it to maintenance volume — do not train upper body hard during this program.
- **Switching phase exercises**: The program prescribes speed squats, but box squats, pause squats, or jump squats are all acceptable. The goal is explosive movement at light weight.

### Is the Smolov Squat Program good for beginners?

No. Smolov requires advanced squat technique, at least 3 years of consistent training, and the ability to recover from extremely high workloads. Beginners should run a linear progression program first and build a solid strength base before considering Smolov.

### How much weight can you add with the Smolov Squat Program?

Most experienced lifters report adding 40-100 lbs to their squat 1RM over the 13-week cycle. Results depend on training history, diet, sleep, and starting strength level. Lighter lifters and those with higher starting squats tend to gain less (20-40 lbs), while intermediate-advanced lifters often see 50-80 lbs.

### Can I do deadlifts during the Smolov Squat Program?

Deadlifting is not recommended during Smolov. The squat volume and intensity are so high that adding deadlifts creates significant recovery interference. If you must deadlift, limit it to light Romanian deadlifts (2-3 sets of 8 at 50-60% 1RM) once per week during the Switching Phase only.

### How should I eat during the Smolov Squat Program?

Eat at a caloric surplus of at least 500 calories per day. Prioritize protein (0.8-1g per lb of bodyweight), carbohydrates around training (especially before and after squat sessions), and adequate hydration. Many lifters gain 5-10 lbs of bodyweight during the program. This is not the time to cut.

### What if I miss a session on the Smolov Squat Program?

If you miss one session, shift the remaining sessions back by one day and continue. If you miss an entire week, you'll likely need to restart that phase. The program's effectiveness depends on maintaining the prescribed frequency — sporadic training will not produce results.

### Can I run the Smolov Squat Program for bench press?

The full 13-week Smolov is designed for the squat. For bench press, use Smolov Jr. instead — it's a 3-week adaptation of the Base Mesocycle that works well for bench. Running the full Smolov for bench press creates excessive shoulder stress and is not recommended.

### How do I update my 1RM after the Base Mesocycle max test?

After testing your new 1RM at the end of week 6, tap the Squat exercise name in the app, then edit your 1RM to the new value. The Intense Mesocycle (weeks 9-12) and Taper (week 13) percentages will automatically recalculate based on this updated number. Use 90-95% of your new true max, not the full number.

### Is the Smolov Squat Program bad for your knees?

Smolov carries higher injury risk than most programs due to the extreme squat frequency and volume. Knee pain and inflammation are the most commonly reported issues. To mitigate risk: warm up thoroughly, use knee sleeves (not wraps), maintain proper squat depth and tracking, and stop immediately if you feel sharp or persistent pain. If you have a history of knee issues, this program is not appropriate.
