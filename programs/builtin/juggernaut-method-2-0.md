A 16-week block periodization program by Chad Wesley Smith of Juggernaut Training Systems. Progresses through four waves of decreasing rep ranges (10s, 8s, 5s, 3s) while increasing intensity, with AMRAP-based autoregulation to update your working weights each wave.

## Origin & Philosophy

The Juggernaut Method 2.0 was created by [Chad Wesley Smith](https://www.jtsstrength.com/), founder of Juggernaut Training Systems. Chad is an elite-level strength athlete who held an American squat record of 905 lb (410 kg) and competed at the top level in powerlifting, strongman, and shot put. He published the original Juggernaut Method in 2012 and the updated 2.0 version in 2013.

The program is heavily influenced by Jim Wendler's 5/3/1, Doug Young's training philosophy, and block periodization principles. The core idea is that submaximal training — never exceeding 90% of your training max — builds work capacity, reinforces technique, and drives long-term progress more reliably than constantly grinding near maximal loads. Autoregulation through AMRAP sets ensures your training max adjusts to your actual performance each wave.

## Who It's For

The Juggernaut Method 2.0 is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters with at least 1-2 years of consistent barbell training. You should be comfortable with [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Deadlift}], and ideally have run a linear progression program to its limits. The program works well for powerlifters, strength athletes, and anyone whose primary goal is getting stronger on the big lifts. It's suitable for both bulking and maintenance phases.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Submaximal training (never above 90% of TM) reduces injury risk and technical breakdown
- Built-in autoregulation via AMRAP sets adjusts weights to your actual performance
- High-rep early waves build significant work capacity and muscle mass
- Deload every 4th week prevents cumulative fatigue from derailing progress
- Straightforward structure — once you understand the 4-phase wave pattern, it repeats predictably

**Cons:**
- Each lift is trained only once per week, which may be insufficient frequency for some lifters
- No prescribed accessory work — you must program your own assistance exercises
- 16 weeks is a significant commitment before you can evaluate results
- The 10s wave can feel very light for experienced lifters, especially in the first few weeks
- Sessions are short on main lift work — the program assumes you'll add accessories to fill out training time

## Program Structure

The Juggernaut Method 2.0 is a 16-week block periodization program with 4 training days per week. Each day is dedicated to one of the four main lifts: [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Deadlift}].

The 16 weeks are divided into four 4-week waves, each targeting a different rep range:
- **Wave 1 (10s):** Weeks 1-4 — high reps, moderate weight
- **Wave 2 (8s):** Weeks 5-8 — moderate reps, moderate-heavy weight
- **Wave 3 (5s):** Weeks 9-12 — low reps, heavy weight
- **Wave 4 (3s):** Weeks 13-16 — very low reps, near-maximal weight

Within each wave, the four weeks follow a consistent pattern:
1. **Accumulation** — high volume at moderate intensity, building work capacity
2. **Intensification** — reduced volume at higher intensity, building strength
3. **Realization** — ramp-up sets leading to one all-out AMRAP set at the highest intensity of the wave
4. **Deload** — light recovery work to prepare for the next wave

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

The program centers on the "big four" barbell lifts because they allow the heaviest loading and most transferable strength development. [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] form the lower body foundation, while [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] cover horizontal and vertical pressing. Each lift gets a dedicated day to allow full recovery between sessions.

Accessory work is intentionally left to the lifter. Chad recommends choosing assistance exercises that address your individual weaknesses — rows and pull-ups for back health, dips or close-grip bench for triceps, and core work for stability. You should follow a similar periodization approach for accessories (higher reps early in the cycle, lower reps later).

## Set & Rep Scheme

Each wave uses a distinct rep target that decreases as the program progresses:

**Accumulation weeks** use straight sets at the wave's target rep count:
- 10s wave: 4×10 at 54% of 1RM (60% of TM)
- 8s wave: 4×8 at 59% of 1RM (65% of TM)
- 5s wave: 5×5 at 63% of 1RM (70% of TM)
- 3s wave: 6×3 at 68% of 1RM (75% of TM)
The last set of each accumulation session is AMRAP, but you should leave 2-3 reps in the tank.

**Intensification weeks** add ramp-up sets before the working weight and reduce volume:
- 10s wave: ramp to 61% of 1RM (67.5% of TM), then 2×10 + 1×10 AMRAP
- 8s wave: ramp to 65% of 1RM (72.5% of TM), then 2×8 + 1×8 AMRAP
- 5s wave: ramp to 70% of 1RM (77.5% of TM), then 3×5 + 1×5 AMRAP
- 3s wave: ramp to 74% of 1RM (82.5% of TM), then 4×3 + 1×3 AMRAP
Leave 1-2 reps in the tank on the AMRAP set.

**Realization weeks** ramp up through progressively heavier singles/doubles/triples to one all-out AMRAP set:
- 10s wave: ramp to 68% of 1RM (75% of TM), AMRAP (target 10+)
- 8s wave: ramp to 72% of 1RM (80% of TM), AMRAP (target 8+)
- 5s wave: ramp to 77% of 1RM (85% of TM), AMRAP (target 5+)
- 3s wave: ramp to 81% of 1RM (90% of TM), AMRAP (target 3+)
Go all out — leave nothing in the tank.

**Deload weeks** use light straight sets: 36%×5, 45%×5, 54%×5 of 1RM.

## Progressive Overload

Progression happens at the end of each 4-week wave based on your realization AMRAP performance. After completing the all-out AMRAP in the realization week, your 1RM is recalculated using the weight and reps achieved. This new estimated 1RM automatically adjusts all percentage-based weights for the next wave.

For example, if your 1RM going into the 10s wave is 300 lb, your realization AMRAP is at 68% (~204 lb). If you hit 15 reps at 204 lb, the app estimates a new 1RM higher than 300 lb, and all subsequent wave percentages adjust upward.

If you only hit the target reps or fewer, your 1RM stays roughly the same or decreases slightly, which is the program's built-in autoregulation keeping you honest.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

Run the full 16-week cycle at minimum. Many lifters run 2-3 consecutive cycles (32-48 weeks) with continued progress, especially if they're still in the intermediate phase. Signs it's time to move on include consistently failing to hit the standard rep targets on realization weeks, or stalling on AMRAP numbers across multiple waves.

After the Juggernaut Method, good options include the Inverted Juggernaut Method (which flips set/rep structure for the first two waves), combining Juggernaut with 5/3/1, or moving to a higher-frequency program if you need more practice with the lifts.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates (the only equipment required for all four main lifts)
- Squat rack or power rack
- Flat bench

For accessories, you may want access to a pull-up bar, cable machine, or dumbbells, but the main program requires only basic barbell equipment.

## Rest Times

Chad doesn't prescribe exact rest times, but general guidelines apply:
- Accumulation weeks: 2-3 minutes between working sets
- Intensification weeks: 3-4 minutes between working sets
- Realization weeks: 3-5 minutes between ramp-up sets, full recovery before the AMRAP
- Deload weeks: 1-2 minutes (keep it easy)

## How to Pick Starting Weights

Set your 1RM in the app for each of the four main lifts. All working weights are calculated as percentages of your 1RM. If you don't know your 1RM, use a recent heavy set and a rep max calculator to estimate it (e.g., a set of 5 reps to failure can estimate your 1RM).

The program uses approximately 90% of your true 1RM as an internal "training max" — the percentages in the app already account for this built-in conservatism. Start with accurate 1RM values; the AMRAP-based autoregulation will correct any miscalculation within the first wave.

## Common Modifications

- **Inverted Juggernaut Method**: Flip sets and reps in the 10s and 8s waves (e.g., 10×5 instead of 5×10). This is Chad's preferred variant for more advanced lifters
- **Adding 5/3/1 supplemental work**: Some lifters run Juggernaut for the main lift and 5/3/1 BBB-style supplemental sets afterward
- **3-day variant**: Drop one day and rotate the four lifts across three weekly sessions
- **Assistance templates**: Pair each main lift day with 2-3 accessories — e.g., rows and curls on bench day, RDLs and leg curls on squat day

### Is the Juggernaut Method 2.0 good for beginners?

No. The Juggernaut Method 2.0 is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters who have already exhausted linear progression. Beginners should run a simpler program first to build base strength and technique on the main lifts.

### How many days a week is the Juggernaut Method 2.0?

The program runs 4 days per week, with each day dedicated to one main lift: [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Deadlift}]. A typical schedule is Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Friday or Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday.

### What accessories should I do with the Juggernaut Method?

Chad recommends choosing accessories based on your individual weaknesses. Common choices include rows and pull-ups for back work, dips or close-grip bench for pressing, Romanian deadlifts or lunges for leg development, and ab wheel or hanging leg raises for core. Do 2-4 accessory exercises per session.

### How does the AMRAP update my training max in the Juggernaut Method 2.0?

After each realization week, the app uses your AMRAP performance (weight × reps) to estimate a new 1RM. If you exceed the target reps (10, 8, 5, or 3 depending on the wave), your estimated 1RM increases, which raises all working weights for the next wave. If you only hit the minimum, weights stay roughly the same.

### Can I run the Juggernaut Method 2.0 while cutting?

You can, but expect slower progress and lower AMRAP numbers. The high-volume accumulation weeks may feel especially draining on a caloric deficit. Consider reducing accessory volume by about 50% if recovery is an issue.

### What's the difference between the original Juggernaut Method and version 2.0?

Version 2.0 added the Inverted Juggernaut variant, undulating periodization models, the 9-day work week option, and a powerlifting peaking template. The core wave structure (10s/8s/5s/3s with accumulation/intensification/realization/deload) remains the same.

### How long should I rest between sets on the Juggernaut Method?

Rest 2-3 minutes during accumulation weeks, 3-4 minutes during intensification, and take full recovery (3-5 minutes) during realization week before your AMRAP set. Deload weeks should use short rest periods of 1-2 minutes.

### What do I do if I miss the target reps on the realization AMRAP?

If you only hit the target or fewer reps, your 1RM estimate stays flat or drops slightly for the next wave. This is normal autoregulation — the program adjusts downward to keep you training at appropriate intensities. Don't increase your 1RM manually.
