A beginner barbell program and the advanced novice phase of Starting Strength. [{Chin Up}] added for upper body pulling volume. [{Deadlift}] and [{Power Clean}] alternate within Workout A, creating a four-workout rotation. Microloading (2.5lb jumps) typically needed for [{Overhead Press}] and [{Bench Press}] at this stage.

## Origin & Philosophy

Starting Strength was created by **Mark Rippetoe**, a competitive powerlifter and strength coach based in Wichita Falls, Texas. The program is detailed in his book *Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training*, first published in 2005 and now in its [3rd edition (2011)](https://aasgaardco.com/store/books-702/starting-strength-basic-barbell-training-3rd-edition/). The companion book *Practical Programming for Strength Training* covers the programming theory behind the novice progression.

The core philosophy: beginners can add weight to the bar every single session for months — the "Novice Effect." Rather than waste this window on machines or complicated periodization, Starting Strength exploits it with a handful of barbell movements, linear loading, and full recovery between sessions. Strength is treated as the most fundamental physical adaptation — muscle size, power, and endurance all improve as side effects of getting stronger.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Beginner lifters who have completed Phases 1 and 2 (typically 2–4 months of training)
- **Goal**: Squeeze the last gains out of novice linear progression before transitioning to intermediate programming
- **Prerequisites**: Solid form on all 5 lifts from Phase 2. Upper body lifts starting to slow down or stall with 5lb jumps.
- **Diet**: Caloric surplus still recommended. Recovery demands are highest in this phase since all weights are near personal records

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- [{Chin Up}] adds much-needed upper body pulling volume — improves back development and bicep strength
- Alternating [{Deadlift}] and [{Power Clean}] on A days reduces fatigue while maintaining both movement patterns
- Microloading extends upper body linear progression for several more weeks past where 5lb jumps would stall
- Still a simple program — 3 exercises per session, 3 days per week

**Cons**

- Four-workout rotation is more complex to track than Phase 2's simple A/B alternation
- No direct arm, ab, or lateral delt work — [{Chin Up}] helps biceps but isolation work is still absent
- [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] are each only trained 3 times every 4 sessions — even lower frequency than Phase 2
- You're near the end of novice gains — progress is noticeably slower and stalls become more frequent
- Requires microplates (1.25lb each) for upper body lifts — most gyms don't have these

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, 4-workout rotation
- **Periodization**: Straight linear progression — add weight every session
- **Rotation**: Four workouts (A1, B1, A2, B2) cycle continuously. With 3 sessions per week, the pattern shifts each week
- Train 3 days per week on non-consecutive days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)

The press/bench alternation and the deadlift/power clean alternation are now **independent** of each other. This creates 4 distinct workouts:

| Workout | Lift 1 | Lift 2 | Lift 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| A1 | [{Squat}] | [{Bench Press}] | [{Deadlift}] |
| B1 | [{Squat}] | [{Overhead Press}] | [{Chin Up}] |
| A2 | [{Squat}] | [{Overhead Press}] | [{Power Clean}] |
| B2 | [{Squat}] | [{Bench Press}] | [{Chin Up}] |

A sample 3-week rotation training Mon/Wed/Fri:

| | Monday | Wednesday | Friday |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|
| Week 1 | A1 | B1 | A2 |
| Week 2 | B2 | A1 | B1 |
| Week 3 | A2 | B2 | A1 |

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

[{Squat}] still leads every session — by Phase 3, your squat technique is solid and the weight is heavy enough that you need to be fresh for it.

[{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] continue to alternate, but now across a 4-workout cycle instead of 2. Each pressing movement is trained roughly 1x/week. This is lower frequency than Phase 2, but at this stage the weights are heavy enough that more recovery between pressing sessions is beneficial.

[{Deadlift}] and [{Power Clean}] now **both** appear only on A-days, alternating between them. This further reduces deadlift frequency (from every A-day in Phase 2 to every other A-day here), which is necessary because deadlift weights are now very heavy relative to the lifter's capacity.

[{Chin Up}] is the new addition, appearing on all B-days. It fills a gap in the program — until now there was no direct upper back pulling work besides deadlifts and cleans. Chin-ups build the lats, biceps, and forearms, and the strength carries over to deadlift lockout and bench press stability.

**Substitutions**: If you can't do [{Chin Up}] for 3 sets of 10, use [{Lat Pulldown}] (3x10) or band-assisted chin-ups until you build enough strength. If still substituting [{Bent Over Row}] for [{Power Clean}], that continues to work here.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}]: **3x5** — same as previous phases
- [{Deadlift}]: **1x5** — same as previous phases
- [{Power Clean}]: **5x3** — same as Phase 2
- [{Chin Up}]: **3x10** — higher reps than the other exercises because chin-ups at bodyweight are less taxing. Once you can do 3x10 at bodyweight, start adding weight (via dip belt) and do 3x5 on alternate chin-up sessions

## Progressive Overload

**Weight increases per session:**

| Lift | Increase |
|------|----------|
| [{Squat}] | +5lb |
| [{Deadlift}] | +5lb |
| [{Bench Press}] | +2.5lb (microloading) |
| [{Overhead Press}] | +2.5lb (microloading) |
| [{Power Clean}] | +2.5lb (microloading) |
| [{Chin Up}] | +2.5lb (once doing weighted chin-ups) |

Phase 3 is where **microloading becomes essential** for upper body lifts. You'll need fractional plates (1.25lb each side) to make 2.5lb total jumps. Without them, you'll stall much sooner on [{Overhead Press}] and [{Bench Press}].

**When you stall** (can't complete all prescribed reps for 2 consecutive workouts on the same lift):

1. **Deload 10%** from your current working weight on that lift
2. Work back up using normal session-to-session increases
3. After 2–3 deloads with no sustained progress, that lift is done with novice linear progression — transition it to intermediate programming

Each lift is tracked independently. You may finish linear progression on [{Overhead Press}] months before [{Squat}]. Only change programming for the lifts that have truly stalled.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Run Phase 3 until linear progression is exhausted** — typically several weeks to a couple months after entering this phase. Total time on the Starting Strength novice program (all phases combined) is usually **3–9 months**.

**Signs it's time to move on**: You're deloading repeatedly on [{Squat}] and [{Deadlift}] despite good sleep and nutrition. Multiple lifts have stalled through 2–3 deload cycles.

**Good next programs**:
- **Texas Method** — the natural continuation recommended by Rippetoe; weekly periodization with volume/recovery/intensity days
- **Madcow 5x5** — similar weekly progression with ramping sets
- **5/3/1** — monthly periodization, very flexible, runs indefinitely
- **GZCLP** — tiered approach with more exercise variety

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates
- Squat rack or power rack
- Flat bench
- Pull-up bar (or [{Lat Pulldown}] machine as substitute)
- **Microplates** (1.25lb each) — essential for Phase 3. Buy your own; most gyms don't have them
- Dip belt for weighted [{Chin Up}] (once bodyweight becomes easy)

If doing [{Power Clean}], bumper plates and a platform are ideal but not strictly required.

## Rest Times

- **Warmup sets**: Just long enough to change plates (30–60 seconds)
- **Early work sets**: 2–3 minutes
- **Heavy work sets**: 3–5 minutes (up to 7 minutes near max effort on [{Squat}]/[{Deadlift}])
- **Chin-ups**: 2–3 minutes between sets

Rest as long as needed to complete the next set. At Phase 3 weights, you'll need the full rest periods — don't rush.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

If transitioning from Phase 2, continue with your current weights on all existing lifts. Start [{Chin Up}] at bodyweight (0lb added).

If starting the program fresh in Phase 3 (not recommended — start from Phase 1), use this method for each exercise:

1. Start with the empty bar (45lb) for a set of 5
2. Add 10–20lb, do another set of 5
3. Repeat until bar speed noticeably slows
4. Use that weight as your first working weight

## Common Modifications

- **Light squat day**: Some advanced novices add a lighter squat session (80% of work weight, 2x5) on the middle training day to aid recovery. This is the "advanced novice" modification from *Practical Programming*.
- **Weighted chin-ups**: Once you can complete 3x10 at bodyweight, alternate between bodyweight chin-ups to failure and weighted 3x5 chin-ups on different B days.
- **Replace [{Power Clean}] with [{Bent Over Row}]**: Still valid in Phase 3. Rows at 3x5 or 5x3 work well.
- **Add accessories**: At this stage, some lifters add 1–2 light accessories after the main lifts: [{Back Extension, Bodyweight}] (3x10), [{Bicep Curl}] (3x10), or [{Hanging Leg Raise}] (3x10). Keep them light and don't let them interfere with recovery for the main lifts.
- **Drop to 3x3 or 5x1 on lifts near failure**: If you're consistently missing the 5th rep, some coaches recommend temporarily dropping to triples or singles at higher weight to continue progressing before transitioning to intermediate programming.
