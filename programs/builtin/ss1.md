A beginner barbell program and the introductory phase of Starting Strength. Only four exercises: [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}], and [{Deadlift}]. Every session includes deadlifts while the weight is still light enough to recover from. Run this for 1–3 weeks, then move to Phase 2 when deadlift recovery becomes difficult.

## Origin & Philosophy

Starting Strength was created by **Mark Rippetoe**, a competitive powerlifter and strength coach based in Wichita Falls, Texas. The program is detailed in his book *Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training*, first published in 2005 and now in its [3rd edition (2011)](https://aasgaardco.com/store/books-702/starting-strength-basic-barbell-training-3rd-edition/). The companion book *Practical Programming for Strength Training* covers the programming theory behind the novice progression.

The core philosophy: beginners can add weight to the bar every single session for months — the "Novice Effect." Rather than waste this window on machines or complicated periodization, Starting Strength exploits it with a handful of barbell movements, linear loading, and full recovery between sessions. Strength is treated as the most fundamental physical adaptation — muscle size, power, and endurance all improve as side effects of getting stronger.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Complete beginners stepping into a gym for the first time, or lifters returning after a long layoff
- **Goal**: Learn the basic barbell lifts and build foundational strength as fast as possible
- **Prerequisites**: Access to a barbell, squat rack, and bench — nothing else
- **Diet**: Best run on a caloric surplus. Works on maintenance calories too, but progress will slow sooner

Phase 1 is specifically for your **first 1–3 weeks** of training. It keeps things as simple as possible — only 4 exercises — so you can focus entirely on learning the movements.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- Only 4 exercises to learn — minimizes overwhelm for a true beginner
- Deadlifting every session maximizes practice on the most important pulling movement while weights are still light
- Fastest initial strength gains — 10lb squat jumps and 15–20lb deadlift jumps are normal in the first week
- Sessions are short (~30–40 minutes) with only 3 exercises each

**Cons**

- No direct upper back, arm, or ab work — your arms and abs grow only indirectly from the main lifts
- Only 1 set of [{Deadlift}] per session — feels like not enough for some lifters, but recovery demands will prove otherwise quickly
- [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] are each only trained 3 times every 2 weeks — low frequency for upper body
- Very short phase — you'll transition to Phase 2 within weeks, so it can feel like you barely started

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, A/B alternating
- **Periodization**: Straight linear progression — add weight every session
- **Rotation**: Week 1 = A/B/A, Week 2 = B/A/B, repeat
- Train 3 days per week on non-consecutive days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)

Both workouts are identical except [{Bench Press}] and [{Overhead Press}] alternate. [{Deadlift}] is in every session.

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

Every session starts with [{Squat}] because it trains the most muscle mass and benefits most from high frequency. Squatting 3x/week maximizes the technique practice that drives rapid novice gains.

The second exercise alternates between [{Bench Press}] (horizontal push) and [{Overhead Press}] (vertical push). Together they build complete pressing strength. Alternating gives each lift recovery time.

[{Deadlift}] finishes every session. In Phase 1, weights are light enough that deadlifting 3x/week is recoverable. The deadlift trains the entire posterior chain — glutes, hamstrings, back — and is the lift where beginners can add the most weight the fastest.

## Set & Rep Scheme

- [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], [{Overhead Press}]: **3x5** — the classic strength-building scheme. Heavy enough to drive neural adaptation, enough volume to practice the movement.
- [{Deadlift}]: **1x5** — deadlifts are the most systemically fatiguing lift. One heavy set of 5 is sufficient stimulus for a novice. You'll understand why it's only 1 set once the weight gets heavy.

All sets are straight work sets at the same weight. No AMRAP sets, no back-off sets. Hit your 5 reps, add weight next time.

## Progressive Overload

**Weight increases per session:**

| Lift | Standard increase | First few sessions |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|
| [{Squat}] | +5lb | +10lb for first 2–3 sessions |
| [{Deadlift}] | +5lb | +10–15lb for first few sessions |
| [{Bench Press}] | +5lb | — |
| [{Overhead Press}] | +5lb | — |

**When you stall** (can't complete all prescribed reps for 2 consecutive workouts on the same lift):

1. **Deload 10%** from your current working weight on that lift
2. Work back up using normal session-to-session increases

Each lift is tracked independently. Stalling on [{Overhead Press}] doesn't affect [{Squat}] progression.

**Transition to Phase 2**: When your deadlift gets heavy enough that recovering between sessions becomes difficult (typically after 1–3 weeks), move to Starting Strength Phase 2, which replaces deadlifts with [{Power Clean}] on alternate sessions.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Run Phase 1 for 1–3 weeks.** The transition point is when deadlift recovery starts suffering — you'll notice the deadlift feeling sluggish at the start of sessions, or failing to complete sets because of accumulated fatigue rather than true strength limits.

**Move to**: Starting Strength Phase 2. The only change is [{Power Clean}] replaces [{Deadlift}] in Workout B.

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell and plates
- Squat rack or power rack
- Flat bench

The simplest equipment requirements of any Starting Strength phase — no pull-up bar, no microplates, no bumper plates needed.

## Rest Times

- **Warmup sets**: Just long enough to change plates (30–60 seconds)
- **Early work sets**: 2–3 minutes
- **Heavy work sets**: 3–5 minutes (up to 7 minutes near max effort on [{Squat}]/[{Deadlift}])

Rest as long as needed to complete the next set. Rushing rest is the #1 reason novices fail sets they should make.

## How to Pick Starting Weights

On your first day, for each exercise:

1. Start with the empty bar (45lb) for a set of 5
2. Add 10–20lb, do another set of 5
3. Repeat until bar speed noticeably slows
4. Use that weight as your first working weight

**Typical starting points for untrained males**: [{Squat}] 45–85lb, [{Bench Press}] 45–65lb, [{Overhead Press}] 45lb, [{Deadlift}] 95–135lb.

**Start lighter than you think.** You have months of 5lb jumps ahead — starting light and building momentum is far better than starting heavy and stalling in week 2.

## Common Modifications

- **Add chin-ups early**: Some lifters add [{Chin Up}] (3 sets to failure) at the end of Workout B before Phase 3. Rippetoe himself adds them later, but they won't hurt if you want more upper back work.
- **Bigger deadlift jumps**: If 5lb jumps feel trivially easy in the first week, jump 10–15lb per session on deadlift until it starts feeling heavy. This is expected and normal for Phase 1.
- **Can't use 45lb bar**: Use dumbbells or a lighter bar until you can handle the standard 45lb barbell. [{Goblet Squat}] is a good substitute for [{Squat}] in this case.

### Is Starting Strength good for beginners?

Yes, Starting Strength is one of the most well-known beginner barbell programs. Phase 1 uses only 4 exercises — squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift — making it simple to learn. It's designed for complete beginners stepping into a gym for the first time.

### How many days a week is Starting Strength Phase 1?

It's a 3-day program trained on non-consecutive days, typically Monday/Wednesday/Friday. Two alternating workouts (A and B) rotate each session, with each workout containing only 3 exercises.

### How does progression work on Starting Strength?

Starting Strength uses straight linear progression — you add weight every single session. Squat and deadlift increase by 5lb per session (10-15lb in the first few sessions), and bench press and overhead press increase by 5lb per session.

### How long should I run Starting Strength Phase 1?

Phase 1 is designed for your first 1-3 weeks of training only. Move to Phase 2 when your deadlift gets heavy enough that recovering between sessions becomes difficult. Phase 2 introduces power cleans to replace deadlifts on alternate days.

### What is the difference between Starting Strength phases?

Phase 1 has deadlifts every session while weights are light. Phase 2 replaces deadlifts with power cleans on alternate days to aid recovery. Phase 3 adds chin-ups and creates a 4-workout rotation with both deadlifts and power cleans alternating.

### Why does Starting Strength only have 1 set of deadlifts?

Deadlifts are the most systemically fatiguing lift — they tax the entire posterior chain, grip, and central nervous system. One heavy set of 5 is sufficient stimulus for a novice. As the weight gets heavier, you'll understand why more sets aren't needed.
