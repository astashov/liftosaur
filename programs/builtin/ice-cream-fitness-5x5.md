## Origin & Philosophy

Ice Cream Fitness (ICF) 5x5 was created by Jason Blaha and published for free on Muscle & Strength. Blaha explicitly designed it as a novice bodybuilding program, not a pure strength program. The name comes from Blaha's approach to bulking — he famously advocated eating ice cream and other calorie-dense foods to build mass as a beginner.

The program is identical to StrongLifts 5x5 for the main compound movements, then adds isolation exercises at the end of each session. Blaha argued that pure strength programs like Starting Strength neglect hypertrophy work, leaving beginners with strong lifts but underdeveloped arms, shoulders, and abs. ICF bridges the gap between strength and aesthetics by incorporating bodybuilding accessories into a linear progression framework.

In 2019, Blaha released ICF 2.0, which reduces working sets from 5x5 to 3x5 and cuts some accessories to shorten session length. This description covers the original 5x5 version, which remains more popular.

## Who It's For

- **Experience**: Complete beginners with 0-6 months of consistent training
- **Goal**: Build a foundation of strength in the main lifts while developing muscle mass, particularly arms and upper body
- **Time availability**: 90+ minute sessions three times per week
- **Works best on a bulk**: Novices can make progress on maintenance or a cut, but a caloric surplus will maximize both strength and size gains

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- [{Squat}] 3x/week builds proficiency in the most important compound movement fast
- Adds direct arm work ([{Barbell Shrugs}], [{Tricep Extension, Cable}], [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}]) that StrongLifts and Starting Strength lack
- [{Hyperextension}] and [{Cable Crunch}] provide posterior chain and core work beyond just the main lifts
- Linear progression is simple: add weight every session when all reps are completed
- High frequency on [{Bench Press}] and [{Bent Over Row}] (3x/week and 2x/week) builds upper body size and strength quickly

**Cons**

- Sessions regularly take 90-120 minutes once weights get heavy, which is impractical for many schedules
- 5x5 squats 3x/week becomes brutally fatiguing as weight increases, often leading to stalls within 8-12 weeks
- No direct lateral delt, rear delt, or calf work unless you add your own
- [{Deadlift}] only once per week at 1x5 means less practice on the most technical lift
- Accessories at 3x8 with only 1-2 minutes rest can compromise recovery for the main lifts

## Program Structure

- **Split**: Full body, 2-workout alternating schedule
- **Periodization**: Linear progression (add weight every session)
- **Schedule**: 3 days per week on non-consecutive days, alternating Workout A and B

**Typical week structure**: Monday (A), Wednesday (B), Friday (A), then next week Monday (B), Wednesday (A), Friday (B).

## Exercise Selection & Rationale

**Workout A** centers on [{Squat}], [{Bench Press}], and [{Bent Over Row}] as the main 5x5 lifts. Accessories target traps ([{Barbell Shrugs}]), triceps ([{Tricep Extension, Cable}]), biceps ([{Bicep Curl, Barbell}]), lower back ([{Hyperextension}]), and abs ([{Cable Crunch}]).

**Workout B** centers on [{Squat}] again, [{Deadlift}] (1x5 only to manage fatigue), [{Standing Press}], and a second day of [{Bent Over Row}] at 10% lighter weight to add upper back volume without interfering with deadlift recovery. Accessories are [{Close Grip Bench Press}] for triceps, [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}] for arms, and [{Cable Crunch}] for abs.

The exercise selection prioritizes the "big 3" powerlifts (squat, bench, deadlift) plus overhead press and rowing for balanced upper body development. Accessories fill gaps in arm and ab development that compound movements alone don't fully address.

**Substitutions**: [{Bent Over Row}] can be swapped for [{Pendlay Row}]. [{Hyperextension}] can be replaced with [{Back Extension, Bodyweight}] or [{Romanian Deadlift, Dumbbell}] for 2x10. [{Cable Crunch}] can be swapped for [{Hanging Leg Raise}] or [{Ab Wheel}]. Avoid substituting the main barbell lifts.

## Set & Rep Scheme

**Main lifts** (Squat, Bench Press, Bent Over Row, Standing Press): 5 sets of 5 reps. [{Deadlift}] is 1 set of 5 reps to minimize central nervous system fatigue.

**Accessories**: 3 sets of 8 reps for [{Barbell Shrugs}], [{Tricep Extension, Cable}], [{Bicep Curl, Barbell}], and [{Close Grip Bench Press}]. 2 sets of 10 reps for [{Hyperextension}]. 3 sets of 10 reps for [{Cable Crunch}].

The 5x5 scheme uses ~80-85% of 1RM, which is heavy enough to build strength but allows enough volume for hypertrophy. Accessories use higher reps (8-10) at lower intensity to accumulate volume without excessive fatigue.

## Progressive Overload

**During a bulk**, add weight every session after successfully completing all prescribed reps:

| Exercise Type | Weight Increase |
|---------------|----------------|
| [{Squat}], [{Deadlift}] | +5lb (2.5kg) |
| [{Bench Press}], [{Standing Press}], [{Bent Over Row}] | +2.5lb (1.25kg) if available, otherwise +5lb |
| Accessories | Add weight when you can complete 3x8 or 2x10 with good form |

**On failure** (unable to complete all reps): Repeat the same weight next session. If you fail again, reduce weight by 10%, round down, and rebuild.

**During a cut**, use 3x5 for main lifts instead of 5x5, and 2x8 for accessories instead of 3x8. Progress every other session instead of every session.

## How Long to Run It / What Next

**Run for 8-16 weeks.** Expect to stall on upper body lifts around week 8-10 and lower body lifts around week 12-14. When you're deloading on 2+ lifts and progress has slowed significantly, it's time to move on.

**Good next programs**:
- [GZCLP](/programs/gzclp) — tiered structure with better stall protocols and more sustainable volume
- [5/3/1 for Beginners](/programs/the5314b) — monthly progression with auto-regulation via AMRAP sets
- Phul or upper/lower split — if you want to increase training frequency to 4 days/week

## Equipment Needed

- Barbell, weight plates, squat rack, flat bench, deadlift platform
- Cable machine for tricep extensions, crunches, and potentially face pulls if added
- Pull-up bar or dip station optional but useful

**Home gym modifications**: Replace cable exercises with dumbbell or bodyweight alternatives. [{Tricep Extension, Cable}] becomes [{Overhead Triceps Extension, Dumbbell}]. [{Cable Crunch}] becomes [{Crunch}] or [{Hanging Leg Raise}]. [{Barbell Shrugs}] can be done with [{Shrug, Dumbbell}] or [{Shrug, Trap Bar}].

## Rest Times

- **5x5 compound lifts**: 3-5 minutes between sets (as weights get heavier, rest closer to 5 minutes)
- **1x5 deadlift**: No additional rest needed (it's only one set)
- **3x8 accessories**: 1-2 minutes between sets
- **2x10 hyperextensions and 3x10 cable crunches**: 60-90 seconds

## How to Pick Starting Weights

The program doesn't specify 1RM percentages. Instead, start conservatively and let linear progression bring you to challenging weights.

**If you have training history**: Use weights you can confidently complete for 5x5 with 1-2 reps in reserve on the last set. This is typically 75-80% of your 5-rep max.

**If you're a complete beginner**:
- [{Squat}]: Start with 45lb (empty bar) or 65-95lb if the empty bar is too light
- [{Bench Press}], [{Standing Press}], [{Bent Over Row}]: Start with 45lb (empty bar)
- [{Deadlift}]: Start with 95-135lb (since you can't deadlift an empty bar from the floor safely)
- Accessories: Start with light weight and focus on feeling the target muscle

**Common mistake**: Starting too heavy. The progression rate (5lb/session on squats = +60lb in 4 weeks) is aggressive. If you start at 80% of your max, you'll be grinding your absolute limit within 3-4 weeks and stall immediately.

## Common Modifications

- **Cut session length**: Drop 1-2 accessory exercises per session. Common cuts are [{Hyperextension}] or one set of curls. Or switch to ICF 2.0, which uses 3x5 instead of 5x5.
- **Add rear delts**: Include 3x15 [{Face Pull, Cable}] at the end of Workout A
- **Add calves**: Include 3x12-15 [{Calf Raise, Barbell}] at the end of each workout
- **More deadlift volume**: Advanced beginners can add 3x5 [{Romanian Deadlift, Barbell}] on Workout A to practice the hip hinge pattern more frequently
- **Front squat variation**: Swap one squat session per week to [{Front Squat}] to reduce lower back fatigue

### Is Ice Cream Fitness 5x5 good for beginners?

Yes. Ice Cream Fitness is explicitly a novice bodybuilding program. It uses simple linear progression on the main lifts and adds isolation work for areas (arms, abs) that pure strength programs neglect. The downside is session length — expect 90+ minute workouts once the weights get heavy.

### How many days a week is Ice Cream Fitness 5x5?

It's a 3-day-per-week program on non-consecutive days. A typical schedule is Monday/Wednesday/Friday. You alternate between Workout A and Workout B each session.

### What's the difference between Ice Cream Fitness and StrongLifts 5x5?

Ice Cream Fitness is StrongLifts 5x5 with bodybuilding accessories added. The main compound lifts (squat, bench, row, overhead press, deadlift) are identical. ICF adds shrugs, tricep extensions, bicep curls, hyperextensions, and cable crunches for direct muscle development.

### How long should I run Ice Cream Fitness 5x5?

Run it for 8-16 weeks. Most beginners will stall on upper body lifts around week 8-10 and lower body lifts around week 12-14. When you're deloading frequently on multiple lifts, it's time to transition to an intermediate program with slower, more sustainable progression.

### What do I do when I stall on Ice Cream Fitness 5x5?

If you fail to complete all reps on a lift, repeat the same weight next session. If you fail again, reduce the weight by 10% and rebuild. Once you've deloaded on the same lift 2-3 times, the program has run its course and you should move to an intermediate program.

### Can I do Ice Cream Fitness on a cut?

Yes, but reduce volume. Use 3x5 instead of 5x5 for main lifts, 2x8 instead of 3x8 for accessories, and progress every other session instead of every session. Expect slower strength gains, but you can maintain or even build strength as a beginner on a moderate caloric deficit.

### Why is deadlift only 1x5 in Ice Cream Fitness?

Deadlifts are extremely taxing on the central nervous system and lower back. Doing 5x5 deadlifts after squatting 5x5 would cause significant fatigue and interfere with recovery for the next session. The single set of 5 reps provides enough stimulus while managing fatigue.

### What accessories can I add to Ice Cream Fitness 5x5?

Good additions: [{Face Pull, Cable}] for rear delts (3x15-20), [{Calf Raise, Barbell}] for calves (3x12-15), or [{Lateral Raise, Dumbbell}] for side delts (3x12-15). Avoid adding more compound movements or exercises that interfere with recovery from the main lifts. Keep accessories light and high-rep.
